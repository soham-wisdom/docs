The SQL Playground tab provides an interactive environment for writing and executing SQL queries on the domain’s connected data sources. It allows you to inspect tables, validate joins, and test aggregations by writing and running SQL queries against the domain’s connected data sources, with results returned immediately.

Use this tab to explore the underlying data model, troubleshoot query logic, and validate SQL outputs independently of the AI-generated responses.

The SQL Playground is intended for manual exploration and validation. For testing AI behavior using predefined prompt sets and expected SQL outputs, use the Evaluation tab.
