---

To improve how WisdomAI understands and answers user queries, you can add your business context to your Domain. This will help refine data interpretation, align responses with business definitions, and improve overall accuracy.

Here's how to do it:

1. Select the relevant **Domain** from your Domains dashboard.
2. Navigate to the **Context** tab.
3. Select the **Knowledge** tab inside the Context section.
4. Click on the **\+ Add Knowledge** button to begin a new entry, adding natural language context.
   - Alternatively, **upload a file** containing domain-specific information.
   - Here, you can also **download** the context entries in a CSV-format file.
5. **Save** your changes to make the Knowledge available for query interpretation.

### Further Knowledge Configuration

Other key features within the Domain section help you define and refine contextual information for accurate AI responses.

- **DATA SOURCES**: This tab is where you manage and model the raw data structure to make it queryable and insightful within the platform. To enhance Knowledge from the Data Sources tab, you can:
  - [**Document Tables and Columns**](/setting-up-wisdom-ai/document-tables-and-columns): Write clear, natural language descriptions for tables and columns to help the AI interpret schema elements accurately.
  - [**Define Metrics with SQL**](/improve-wisdom-ai-responses/how-to-create-metrics): Use SQL formulas to define key metrics and calculations, ensuring consistency and precision in responses.
