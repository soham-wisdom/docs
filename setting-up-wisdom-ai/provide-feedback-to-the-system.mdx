## Your Feedback Matters

WisdomAI is designed to continuously evolve and improve, and your feedback is the cornerstone of this process. By actively participating in the feedback loop, you contribute directly to a smarter, more accurate, and more helpful AI experience for all users. Your input helps WisdomAI learn through:

- **Direct Corrections:** When you identify incorrect responses and provide the right answer.
- **Query Refinements:** When the system learns from how you modify and refine your questions to get better results.
- **Usage Patterns:** When the system identifies common queries and optimizes its responses for them.

## Feedback Process for All User Roles

Regardless of your user role, your immediate feedback on responses is crucial for WisdomAI's learning.

### Use Thumbs Up (👍) / Thumbs Down (👎)

After WisdomAI provides an answer in the chat interface, you will see a thumbs up (👍) and a thumbs down (👎) icon.

- **Thumbs Up (👍):** If the answer provided by WisdomAI is accurate, relevant, and helpful, click the thumbs up icon. This positive reinforcement helps the system understand what works well.
- **Thumbs Down (👎):** If the answer is incorrect, incomplete, or unhelpful, click the thumbs down icon. This negative feedback immediately flags the response for administrator review and prompts further learning.

### Provide the Correct Text

When you provide negative feedback (👎), you will typically be prompted to offer more details. This is an opportunity to directly educate the system:

- **If the response was incorrect:** You can provide the right answer in the designated text field.
- **If the response was incomplete:** You can add additional context or information that was missing from the answer.

### Refine the Original Question

Another valuable way to provide feedback for all users is by modifying and refining your original question. If the initial query did not deliver the desired result, rephrasing or adding more specific details to your question helps WisdomAI understand user intent better and improve its query interpretation accuracy for future interactions.

## Advanced Feedback Mechanisms for Administrators

As an Administrator, you have elevated capabilities to provide more granular feedback and directly influence WisdomAI's underlying knowledge base.

### SQL Editing

For Administrators, each answer provided in the chat interface comes with an **Edit** button. This powerful feature allows you to directly modify the underlying SQL (Structured Query Language) query that WisdomAI generated to retrieve the answer.

- **How it helps:** This direct access enables you to fix calculation issues, add necessary joins, or modify filters to ensure the query precisely extracts the desired data.
- **Knowledge Base Integration:** Edited queries are not just one-time fixes; they become a permanent part of the system's knowledge base. This means WisdomAI learns from your corrections and will apply the improved logic to similar questions in the future.
- **Value for Domain Experts:** This SQL Edit feature is particularly valuable for domain experts who possess a deep understanding of both the business context and the underlying data model, allowing them to fine-tune the system's data retrieval logic.

### Monitor Negative Feedback (Administrator Review)

Administrators are responsible for reviewing and acting upon the negative feedback provided by all users. WisdomAI provides a structured process for this:

- **Accessing Feedback:** Administrators can view all negative feedback by navigating to the **Chat Log** tab within the WisdomAI interface.
- **Visual Indicators:** Admins can filter by chats that have received negative feedback, making them easy to identify and prioritize for review.
- **Email Notifications:** The system automatically channels negative feedback to administrators via email, ensuring prompt attention to issues that require intervention.
- **Prioritization for Improvement:** Questions marked with negative feedback are automatically prioritized for knowledge base improvement, guiding administrators to the most critical areas needing attention.
- **Dedicated Administration:** For Domains with high usage or complex data, it is highly recommended to assign a dedicated administrator to regularly review feedback and make necessary updates to the knowledge base, ensuring continuous optimal performance.

## Add Sample Q&A for Starters

Adding sample Question & Answer (Q&A) pairs is a proactive method for administrators to enrich WisdomAI's knowledge base and improve its response accuracy for anticipated queries.  This might involve providing a common question and then supplying the precise SQL query that should generate the correct answer, or simply a direct textual answer for factual queries.

A key feature within this process is setting up **Starter Questions**. When "Enabled," these example questions appear to help new users quickly understand the domain's capabilities and get started with WisdomAI. By creating these pre-defined question-answer pairs, you effectively showcase what WisdomAI can do and guide users on how to phrase their queries. 

You can **Edit the default question-answer pairs** to clearly demonstrate the Domain's functionalities. To do so, go to Domains \> Open a Domain \> Advanced Tab \> Starter Questions.

<Note>
  Note that **deleting all the starter questions will automatically disable this feature**.
