title: "Advanced Tutorial: Fine Tuning Your Context"
description: "This advanced tutorial will guide you through the process of fine-tuning your Wisdom AI data to improve chatbot performance for data analysis. You will learn how to make detailed adjustments to context and data sources, including matching columns and fields to ensure accurate and relevant responses."
---

This tutorial is intended for:

- Admin users, who are in charge of configuring data sources and setting up the chatbot.
- Data Administrators, responsible for configuring particular Domains.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Adjust and enrich the context used by Wisdom AI to better understand queries.
- Manage and fine-tune data source connections at a detailed level.
- Match and map columns and fields across multiple data sources for consistency.
- Test and validate your adjustments to ensure the chatbot responds correctly.

Once you have completed this tutorial, you will have fine-tuned your data so the Wisdom AI chatbot can deliver more accurate and context-aware responses, improving its ability to analyze and interact with your data effectively.

## Before you Begin

To follow this tutorial, you should:

- Have Admin/Data Admin access to your Wisdom AI account. Read the <u>How to Request an Environment</u> guide to know more about it.
- Have read the <u>Basic Tutorial: Connect and Experiment</u> tutorial to learn how to **Connect to your Data Sources** and how to **create Domains**.
- Have already created at least one Domain.

## Fine-tune your Context and Responses

To improve how the AI understands and answers user queries, you can fine-tune your domain’s context and logic directly from the **Domain** tab. This section offers multiple tools to refine data interpretation, align responses with business definitions, and improve overall accuracy.

### Access Domain Configuration

1. Navigate to the **Domain** tab in the left sidebar and open it.
2. Select the Domain you would like to fine-tune. A panel with multiple configuration tabs will open.

### Domain Tabs Useful for Context Configuration

These are the key tabs within the Domain section that help you define and refine contextual information for accurate AI responses.

- **KNOWLEDGE**: Here is where you define how the system should interpret your data. By adding natural language Context and Reviewed Queries, you help the AI generate more accurate and business-aligned responses that meet your business's definitions and expectations.

  To start fine-tuning your data, you can:
  - **Add Context**: Provide domain-specific knowledge, rules, or naming conventions in natural language to guide the AI’s understanding.
  - **Add Reviewed Queries**: Pair natural language questions with their ideal SQL responses to train the system on how key questions should be answered.
- **SUGGESTIONS**: System-generated recommendations that help improve context by identifying ambiguities, missing relationships, or areas where clarification is needed.

## Context

In the Context section, you can share domain-specific knowledge or information in natural language sentences. This helps the system understand your business context and formulate precise queries. For example, you can provide information like: '_Regions are the same as Territories_' or _'My sales stages are: Prospect, Negotiation, Closed_'.

### Benefits of Adding Context

- **Accuracy:** Helps the system interpret ambiguous terms and generate precise queries based on your business logic.
- **Completeness:** Captures domain-specific knowledge that may not exist in table or column names, filling important documentation gaps.
- **Guidance:** Steers the AI to better understand relationships and business rules, improving the quality of responses to natural language questions.

### Add Context

1. Open the relevant **Domain** from your dashboard.
2. Navigate to the **Knowledge** tab within the selected Domain.
3. Select the **Context** tab inside the Knowledge section.
4. Click on the **\+ Add Context** button to begin a new entry.
5. Add natural language context or **upload a file** containing domain-specific information.
6. **Save** your changes to make the context available for query interpretation.

### Example Chat Responses before and After Adding Context

This example illustrates how adding domain-specific context improves the AI's ability to interpret questions accurately and generate more relevant responses.

## Add Reviewed Queries

By reviewing queries, you can help users get a higher degree of confidence in the answers they receive. In this library of pre-validated queries, there are a tuple of a natural language query and its ideal SQL response. This is the most critical aspect of context for the language model to understand your data, since it is directly tied to SQL.

### Benefits of Reviewed Queries

- **Accuracy:** Pre-vetted queries ensure consistent and correct results.
- **Performance:** Optimized query execution paths for common questions.
- **Reusability:** Common business questions can be stored once and reused.
- **Canonicalization:** Standardize the way metrics are calculated and combined.

### Create Reviewed Queries

Reviewed queries are created as part of the chat experience. Each chat response comes with a thumbs up/thumbs down button to provide **feedback**. The thumbs up leads to queries being validated. These queries show up in the **Knowledge** \> **Reviewed Queries** tab once validated.

### Example: Validated Query Definition

**Natural Language Query:** "_What is the monthly revenue by region?"_

```
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('month', o.order_date) AS month,
  r.region_name,
  SUM(o.total_amount) AS revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
JOIN regions r ON c.region_id = r.id
WHERE o.order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '12 months'
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2
```

## Suggestions

## Continuous Learning

WisdomAI continuously improves its understanding through feedback loops with users including:

- **Direct Corrections:** Users can mark responses as incorrect and provide the right answer.
- **Query Refinements:** System learns from how users modify and refine their questions.
- **Usage Patterns:** Identify common queries and optimize for them.
