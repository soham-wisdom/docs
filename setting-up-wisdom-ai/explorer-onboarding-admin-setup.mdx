title: "Explorer Onboarding Admin Setup"
---

This guide provides administrators with instructions to configure the onboarding experience for Explorer users. This setup involves the following configurations:

- [Starter Questions:](#starter-questions) Question examples that appear in the chat interface for new domains.
- [Prompt Gallery:](#prompt-gallery) A collection of saved, reviewed queries available for users to reuse.
- [Autocomplete:](#autocomplete) Real-time suggestions that appear as users type in the chat.

## Starter Questions

Starter Questions are disabled by default for new domains. To activate them, you must first generate a set of initial questions. Once generated, you can refine these questions to match your organization's specific terminology. Then, click on **View generated answer** to see the SQL tied to your question and the response.

To find them, go to **Domains** \> _Select a domain_ \> **Advanced** \> **Starter Questions.**

<Note>
  - Currently, you can only **edit or delete** the default Starter Questions. You **cannot add new ones** from scratch.
  - Deleting all Starter Questions disables the feature. To maintain the feature, **edit the existing questions** rather than deleting them.
  - To learn how to edit Starter Questions, read [Add Sample Q&A for Starters](/setting-up-wisdom-ai/feedback-mechanisms/provide-feedback-to-the-system#add-sample-q%26a-for-starters).
</Note>

## Prompt Gallery

The Prompt Gallery is a collection of reusable prompt templates used to populate the Autocomplete suggestions in the chat.

**Prompt templates** are generated from the chat interface when a response is marked as ["reviewed"](https://docs.wisdom.ai/improve-wisdom-ai-responses/validate-and-test-answers#4-mark-the-answer-as-reviewed).

<Note>
  **Topics**

  Prompts are sometimes grouped into Topics to organize the gallery. Topics act as categories for prompts that then appear as cards on the homepage for user selection.
</Note>

## Autocomplete

The Autocomplete feature is directly tied to the prompts you create in the gallery. It is a domain-specific function, which means that a suggestion will only be retrieved from the Prompt Gallery of such a domain.

When a user starts typing a query in the main chat window, the system will search the Prompt Gallery (when available) for relevant prompts and display them as clickable autocomplete suggestions.
