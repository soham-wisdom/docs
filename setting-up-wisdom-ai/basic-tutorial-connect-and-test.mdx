title: "Basic Tutorial: Connect and Test"
---

This tutorial is intended for Admin users, responsible for configuring data sources and setting up the chatbot.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Connect to your Database.
- Start experimenting with your WisdomAI chatbot to test it.
- Provide feedback so the system can create context by itself.

Once you have completed this tutorial, you will have a working chatbot connected to your data and ready to improve through real-time interaction and feedback.

## Before you Begin

To follow this tutorial, you should:

- Have Admin access to your WisdomAI account.
- Know the credentials to access your data source.

## Connect to Data Sources

To get started, you first need to connect your existing data source to WisdomAI so the system can access and prepare your data for use and create reports:

1. Go to the left sidebar, click on **Connections**, and click on the **Add Connection** button to start.

   <Note>
     This action lets you link your existing data sources to WisdomAI. Doing so enables the system to scan metadata. For data warehouse connections, it also allows WisdomAI to fetch data when users ask questions in natural language.
   </Note>

2. Add a **Connection name**. Make it representative so it is easy to identify among other connections.
3. Select the **Data Source** type.

   <Info>
     Access [Supported Data Sources](/getting-started/connect-data-sources/supported-data-sources) to see the complete list of supported data sources by WisdomAI.
   </Info>
4. Once selected, add your data source credentials, including:
   - **Account**
   - **Warehouse**
   - **User**
   - **Role**
   - **Private Key**
   - **Database Filters**
5. After you have added your credentials, click on the **Save and Sync metadata** button.

## Select the Data

After you have added your data source, you will need to select what data you want to use in your project. For this, you will need to create a Domain.

1. Go to **Domains** in the left sidebar.

   <Note>
     A Domain represents a logical business area or function, such as Sales, Marketing, or Finance. Creating well-defined domains makes data more accessible and relevant to business users.
   </Note>
2. Click on the **Add Domain** button. A new window will open.

3. Enter the **Domain name** and a **Description** for it.
4. **Select the database** from the dropdown menu. Once selected, the list of tables will be displayed.
5. Choose the **tables** you would like to use, then drag and drop them into the working area.
6. Click on **Save and continue**. Now you are ready to start testing the WisdomAI chatbot to retrieve information and generate reports about your business.

## Upload CSV files

With WisdomAI, you can seamlessly integrate and analyze your existing data stored in **CSV**, **TSV**, or **Excel** files. Follow these steps to upload your data:

1. Navigate to the **Homepage**.
2. Click the **Domain switcher**.
3. Select the **Upload CSV file...** option.

4. Choose your destination logic:
   - **New Domain**: (Default option) The system creates a new domain from the uploaded file.
   - **Existing Domain**: Select an existing domain (e.g., "B2B Sales - 1Q25") from the **Add to Domain** dropdown.
5. Select the **Table Operation**:
   - **Add as a new CSV Table**: Creates a fresh table within the selected domain.
   - **Replace an existing CSV Table**: Updates the data of a specific table while preserving settings.

6. If replacing data, select the specific table to be replaced from the **Select table to replace** dropdown.
7. Drag and drop your file into the upload area or click to browse.
8. Click **Continue**.

### File configuration

After the initial upload, you must verify the data structure:

1. **Configure Columns**: Review the detected column types (e.g., String, Integer). You can unmark the checkboxes to exclude specific columns from the upload.
2. Click **Preview**.

3. Ensure the data in the preview grid maps correctly. Click **Create table** (or **Replace table** if updating an existing one).

<info>
  **Data Replacement Behavior**
  When you replace an existing CSV table, the system updates only the raw data. All existing column descriptions, settings, and domain configurations remain intact—only the table data itself is replaced.
</info>

## Start Testing

Once your data is set up and selected, you can begin experimenting with your WisdomAI chatbot to see it in action and test its data analysis capabilities. Here are some example questions you may ask:

- _"What was our revenue by region last quarter?"_
- _"Show me customer retention by month."_
- _"Which products had the highest growth rate compared to last year?"_

While experimenting with your chatbot, you can **train** it by providing **feedback**. There are three main ways to do so:

- Using the **thumbs up/down** icons. If your feedback was thumbs down, a new window opens to let you adjust the query accordingly. The more thumbs up/down you provide, the more you will be training the tool to get a high-quality, correct answer.
- By **changing the SQL Code**.
- By **Fine-tuning** the **Context**.

<Info>
  Think about the following scenario: you are telling the system that the Report it has created is not correct, so you provide the accurate data within the chat. If this additional context has not been added through the database tables, you will be able to add it directly through the chat.
</Info>

In all these cases, the system will use the provided data to adjust the context of your database further, enabling it to provide better answers in future searches, as shown in the example images below.
