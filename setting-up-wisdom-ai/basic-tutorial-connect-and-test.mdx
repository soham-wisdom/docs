title: "Basic Tutorial: Connect and Test"
description: "This tutorial will guide you through the essential steps to connect your data source to the Wisdom AI platform and begin testing your chatbot capabilities."
---

This tutorial is intended for Admin users, responsible for configuring data sources and setting up the chatbot.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Connect to your Database.
- Start experimenting with your Wisdom AI chatbot to test it.
- Provide feedback so the system can create context by itself.

Once you have completed this tutorial, you will have a working chatbot connected to your data and ready to improve through real-time interaction and feedback.

## Before you Begin

To follow this tutorial, you should:

- Have Admin access to your Wisdom AI account.
- Know the credentials to access your data source.

## Connect to Data Sources

To get started, you first need to connect your existing data source to Wisdom AI so the system can access and prepare your data for use and create reports:

1. Go to the left sidebar and click on **Connections** and click on the **Add Connection** button to start.

   <Note>
     This action lets you link your existing data sources to Wisdom AI. Doing so enables the system to scan metadata. For data warehouse connections, it also allows Wisdom AI to fetch data when users ask questions in natural language.
   </Note>

2. Add a **Connection name**. Make it representative so it is easy to identify among other connections.
3. Select the **Data Source** type.

   <Info>
     Access [Supported Data Sources](getting-started/supported-data-sources) to see the complete list of supported datasources by Wisdom AI.
   </Info>

4. Once selected, add your data source credentials, including:
   - **Account**
   - **Warehouse**
   - **User**
   - **Role**
   - **Private Key**
   - **Database Filters**

5. After you have added your credentials, click on the **Save and Sync metadata** button.

## Select the Data

After you have added your data source, you will need to select what data you want to use in your project. For this, you will need to create a Domain.

1. Go to **Domains**, in the left side bar.

   <Note>
     A Domain represents a logical business area or function, such as Sales, Marketing, or Finance. Creating well-defined domains makes data more accessible and relevant to business users.
   </Note>

2. Click on the **Add Domain** button. A new window will open.

3. Enter the **Domain name** and a **Description** for it.
4. **Select the database** from the dropdown menu. Once selected, the list of tables will be displayed.
5. Choose the **tables** that you would like to use and drag and drop them to the working area.

   <Note>
     To learn how to fine-tune your data, read the related guide [Advanced Tutorial: Fine Tuning Your Context](setting-up-wisdom-ai/advanced-tutorial-fine-tuning-your-context).
   </Note>

6. Click on **Save and continue**. Now you are ready to start testing Wisdom AI chatbot to retrieve information and generate reports about your business.

## Start Testing

Once your data is set up and selected, you can begin experimenting with your Wisdom AI chatbot to see it in action and test its data analysis capabilities. Here are some example questions you may ask:

- _"What was our revenue by region last quarter?"_
- _"Show me customer retention by month"_
- _"Which products had the highest growth rate compared to last year?"_

While experimenting with your chatbot, you can **train** it by providing **feedback**. There are three main ways to do so:

- Using the **thumbs up/down** icons. If your feedback was thumbs down, a new window opens to let you adjust the query accordingly . The more thumbs up/down you provide, the more you will be training the tool to get a high quality correct answer.
- By **changing the SQL Code**.
- By **Fine-tuning** the **Context**.

<Info>
  Think about the following scenario: you are telling the system that the Report it has created is not correct so you provide the correct data within the chat. If this additional context has not been added through the database tables, you will be able to add it directly through the chat.
</Info>

In all these cases, the system will use the provided data to adjust the context of your database, modelling it further, and making it possible to provide better answers in a future search, as shown in the example images below.
