The Limited Context marker is a key signal for monitoring the quality of WisdomAI responses. It appears when the system lacked complete domain knowledge to confidently answer a question, forcing the Large Language Model (LLM) to make assumptions based on partial information. These responses may still be useful but require closer review to ensure accuracy.

Administrators are responsible for identifying and acting upon Limited Context markers to maintain the precision of the domain configuration:

- **Accessing Limited Context:** Within the **Chat Log**, toggle the **Has Limited Context** switch. Then, click **View details** on the relevant conversation to review responses flagged with Limited Context.

- **Visual Indicators:** Limited Context markers are displayed next to generated visualizations or answers. Access **View details**, hover over the thumbs down (ðŸ‘Ž) icon to view more details about knowledge gaps or uncertainties that affected the response.

- **Validation Process:**
  - If the response is correct, give it a thumbs up to confirm its validity.
  - If corrections are required, fork the chat, edit the visualization or answer, and thumbs up the improved version.
- **Domain Improvement:** Repeated Limited Context markers on similar topics may indicate missing concepts in the knowledge base. Consider updating domain content to reduce future uncertainty and improve overall response quality.
