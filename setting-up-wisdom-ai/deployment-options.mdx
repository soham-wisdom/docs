### Shared Architecture

Regardless of the model you choose, WisdomAI provides:

- **Single-Tenant Infrastructure**: Every customer’s data is isolated within its own environment.
- **Managed Operations**: WisdomAI remains responsible for upgrades, patching, and monitoring.
- **Feature Parity**: The product and its features (Agents and Deep Analysis) are identical in both models.

## WisdomAI Hosted (SaaS)

In this model, WisdomAI hosts your instance within our own secure tenant. Enjoy a true SaaS experience with zero infrastructure responsibility, making it perfect for teams seeking immediate value without the burden of administrative overhead. The advantages of choosing this model are:

- **Zero Infrastructure Management**: WisdomAI handles all upgrades, patching, and monitoring.
- **Fastest Time-to-Value**: Skip cloud provisioning and start using the product immediately.
- **Simplified Billing**: A licensing model where WisdomAI covers all underlying infrastructure costs.
- **Global Reach**: Access the platform across multiple geographic regions.

## Customer-Hosted (Cloud-Prem)

In the Cloud-Prem model, your WisdomAI tenant is deployed **as a managed service** in isolation within your own cloud environment. This option is ideal for organizations with strict data residency mandates or existing cloud spend commitments.

<Note>
  **Important:** This is **not** a traditional self-hosted model. It operates under a hosted SaaS model, where WisdomAI retains minimal access to operate, patch, and update the service remotely, ensuring your version is always up to date.
</Note>

The advantages of choosing Cloud-Prem as your deployment option are:

- **Strict Data Residency**: Data never leaves your organizational boundaries or your chosen cloud account.
- **Cloud Spend Utilization**: Use your existing **AWS, GCP, or Azure spend commitments** to offset hosting costs.
- **Full Operational Visibility**: Maintain access to all raw logs for compliance and security auditing.

### Supported Environments

We support deployment across all major cloud providers:

- **On AWS**: Deployed inside your VPC; compatible with **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**.
- **On GCP**: Deployed within your project; compatible with **VPC Service Controls**.
- **On Azure**: Deployed within your VNet; integrated with **Azure Policy** and **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**.
