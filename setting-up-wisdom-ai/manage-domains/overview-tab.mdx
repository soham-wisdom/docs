From the Overview tab, you can also switch to a diagram view that visualizes the domain’s data model. This view displays:

- Tables as nodes
- Relationships between tables
- Key columns used to join data

Use the diagram view to quickly understand how entities relate to one another and to validate the domain's overall structure at a glance.

<Note>
  The diagram view is read-only and is intended for exploration and orientation. To manage tables or relationships, use the [Data Sources](/domains/data-sources-tab) tab.
