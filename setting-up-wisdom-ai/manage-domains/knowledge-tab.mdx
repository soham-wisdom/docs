title: "Context Tab"
---

The Context tab is where you define how the AI should understand and respond to your business. Here, you provide domain-specific context, terminology, metrics, and validated examples that help ensure responses are accurate, consistent, and aligned with your definitions.

Rather than changing the underlying model, this section provides guidance that shapes how the AI interprets questions and generates answers based on your data and business rules.

The Context tab includes five sub-tabs:

- [Knowledge](#context)
- [Reviewed Queries](#reviewed-queries)
- [Metrics](#metrics)
- [Synonyms](#synonyms)
- [Entities](#entities)

### **Knowledge**

Use this sub-tab to define background information that helps the AI understand what kind of answer is expected, for whom, and in what format. You can:

- Add context entries manually
- Upload or download context entries in bulk
- Search for specific context entries
- Edit or delete existing context

### **Reviewed Queries**

Use this sub-tab to manage reviewed question-and-answer pairs that define how the AI should respond to specific user queries.

Reviewed queries are natural language questions that have been manually reviewed and refined by a subject matter expert to ensure that:

- The question is clear and well-structured
- The intended meaning is correct
- The AI produces a consistent and trustworthy answer when the query is reused

You can upload and download reviewed queries as CSV files, search for specific queries, and see who reviewed each one.

### **Metrics**

Use this sub-tab to define custom business metrics that the AI can reference and explain consistently.

You can create metrics and manage their visibility, name, description, and display format. Defining metrics ensures the AI uses the same definitions and calculations your business relies on.

### **Synonyms**

Use this sub-tab to define groups of words or phrases that should be treated as the same business concept.

Synonym sets help the AI recognize different ways users may refer to the same idea, improving query understanding and retrieval accuracy. This is especially useful for:

- Abbreviations and acronyms
- Aliases and alternative names
- Industry-specific or regional terminology

For example, you can define a synonym set for _USA_ that includes _United States_, _United States of America_, and _U.S._, ensuring all variations are interpreted consistently.

You can create synonym sets manually by clicking on **\+ Add Syninym Set** or import and export them in bulk using CSV files.

### **Entities**

Use this sub-tab to define the key business entities that are central to your domain, such as _Accounts_, _Customers_, or _Opportunities_.

Entities represent meaningful business concepts that the AI should recognize and refer to using natural language, rather than technical identifiers or internal IDs. Defining entities helps align AI responses with how your business actually talks about its data, resulting in a clearer and more intuitive chat experience.

You can define entities by specifying name columns, ID columns, default sorting, and related columns.
