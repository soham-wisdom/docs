Domains define how WisdomAI accesses data, understands business context, and evaluates the accuracy of its responses. All configuration related to data modeling, AI behavior, and quality control is managed at the domain level.

WisdomAI organizes domain configuration into distinct areas, each representing a key aspect of how the system understands and interacts with your data.

Explore the individual tab pages linked below for detailed configuration guidance, best practices, and examples.

- **[Overview](/domains/overview-tab)**: Monitor domain health, usage, and structure at a glance.
