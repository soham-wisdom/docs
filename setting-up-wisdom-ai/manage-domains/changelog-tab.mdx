title: "Changelog Tab"
---

The Changelog tab provides a chronological record of updates applied to the domain, helping you understand what changed, when it changed, and who made the change.

It captures modifications across domains, such as updates to Context items, configuration settings, or other domain-level objects. Each entry includes the time of the change, the domain version, the user who performed the action, the change type (for example, added), and a brief summary of the update.

Use this tab to track recent activity, audit configuration changes, and troubleshoot unexpected behavior by correlating changes with their impact on the domain.
