title: "Set up RAG for Textual Columns"
---

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Textual Columns makes unstructured long texts, such as product reviews or support tickets, available for AI-based summarization and generation.

RAG indexes the content of specific columns so that Wisdom can answer qualitative questions about the data rather than just returning quantitative counts.

## Configuration Steps

To configure RAG for a table, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Domains** > Select your preferred domain > **Data Sources** > **Tables** and locate the table for which you want to configure RAG columns.
2. Click on the **three vertical dots** icon and then on **RAG Settings**.

3. In the **RAG Configuration for Textual Columns** window that opens, complete the following:
   - In the **Text content columns for search** field, select the columns that contain rich text content that will be searched over.
   - In the **Filter columns for queries** field, select columns with structured data (like IDs or dates) that can be used to narrow down search results.
   - In the **Primary key** field, choose one or more columns that uniquely identify each row in the table.
   - In the **Description of search columns** text box, write a brief description of what the combination of the search columns represents. This helps the AI better understand the context of your data.
   - (Optional) Click **Advanced Options** to specify **columns for citation titles** **and URLs** in the AI's answers.
4. Click **Save** to apply your settings. A notification will appear confirming that the configuration is updated and the data sync has been triggered.

## Use Case Example: Analyzing Product Reviews
Imagine a table containing Amazon product reviews with the following columns: `Review ID`, `Product Name`, `Date`, and `Feedback` (the open-ended field that contains long user generated texts). To enable thematic analysis, you would configure the table as follows:

| **Configuration Field** | **Selected Column** | **Purpose** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Text content for search** | `Feedback` | Contains the long texts the AI will summarize. |
| **Filters for queries** | `Product Name`, `Date`| Allows Wisdom to narrow the search to specific items or timeframes. |
| **Primary Key** | `Review ID` | Uniquely identifies each row to aid in accurate data retrieval. |

**This setup would enable WisdomAI to answer these kind of questions:**
* "What are the positive themes for feedback on iPhone?"
* "What are people complaining about for iPhone?"
* "What themes are emerging from feedback about iPhone?"

<Warning>
**Filter Limitations**

If you do not include a column, such as `Date`, in the **Filters for queries** field, WisdomAI cannot effectively use it to narrow down results. For example, if `Date` is not selected as a filter, WisdomAI cannot answer: *"What is the positive feedback for iPhone in 2026?"*
