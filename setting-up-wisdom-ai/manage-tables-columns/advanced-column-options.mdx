title: "Advanced Column Options"
---

If you toggle the **Show advanced options** switch on, the following additional configuration fields will appear, allowing for more granular control over your data model:

| **Field** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Key** | Identifies if the column is a unique identifier for the rows in the table. |
| **Default Order** | Sets the default sorting direction (Ascending or Descending) for the column. |
| **Allowed values** | Defines a list of valid entries to guide WisdomAI's understanding of the column's content. These values are case-sensitive and are used for semantic context only. |
| **Order allowed values** | Enables or disables a specific custom sorting order for the defined allowed values. This custom sequence overrides the Default Order setting. |
| **User identifier** | Marks the column as containing user-specific identifying information such as email or username. |
| **Enable Lookups** | Toggles whether this column can be used for data lookup operations and Name-Entity Recognition (NER). |

## Understanding Lookups and NER

Enabling lookups on textual columns powers Name-Entity Recognition (NER). This helps Wisdom build more accurate SQL queries by mapping user intent to specific database values. The key benefits of enabling this feature are:

* **Token Matching**: WisdomAI identifies the right column to query based on tokens in the question string. For example, "Show me total usage for compute services" will match `service_category = compute`, whereas "total usage for EC2 services" will match `service_name = compute`.
* **Typo Correction**: Fixes minor typos in user questions. For example, "Show me total usage for computer services" will be auto-corrected to `service_category = compute`.

<Tip>
Enable lookups on **VARCHAR** type columns that contain categorical dimensions, such as region names, customer names, or category types.
