title: "Limited Context"
---

The **Limited Context marker** is a key signal for monitoring the quality of WisdomAI responses. It **appears when the system lacked complete domain knowledge to confidently answer a question**, forcing the Large Language Model (LLM) to make assumptions based on partial information. **These responses** may still be useful but **require closer review to ensure accuracy**.

Administrators are responsible for identifying and acting upon Limited Context markers to maintain the precision of the domain configuration. You can find this filter in the **Chat Log**.

Limited Context markers are displayed next to generated visualizations or answers. Access **View details**, hover over the Limited Context [\!] marker and the thumbs down (ðŸ‘Ž) icon to view more details about knowledge gaps or uncertainties that affected the response.

<Warning>
  Repeated Limited Context markers on similar topics may indicate missing concepts in the knowledge base. Consider updating domain content to reduce future uncertainty and improve overall response quality.
