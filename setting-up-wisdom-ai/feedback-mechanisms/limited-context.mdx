title: "Limited Context"
---

The Limited Context marker is a key signal for monitoring the quality of WisdomAI responses. If the system lacked complete domain knowledge to answer a question confidently, it forced the Large Language Model (LLM) to make assumptions based on partial information. These responses may still be helpful but require closer review to ensure accuracy.

Administrators are responsible for identifying and acting upon Limited Context markers to maintain the precision of the domain configuration. You can find this filter in the **Chat Log**.

Limited Context markers are displayed next to generated visualizations or answers. Access **View details**, hover over the Limited Context [!] marker and the thumbs-down (ðŸ‘Ž) icon to view more information about knowledge gaps or uncertainties that affected the response.

<Warning>
  Repeated Limited Context markers on similar topics may indicate missing concepts in the knowledge base. Consider updating domain content to reduce future uncertainty and improve overall response quality.
