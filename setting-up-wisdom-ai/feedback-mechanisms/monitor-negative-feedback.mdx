Administrators are responsible for reviewing and acting upon the negative feedback provided by all users. WisdomAI provides different options for this:

- **Accessing Feedback:** Administrators can view all negative feedback by navigating to the **Chat Log** tab within the WisdomAI interface.
- **Visual Indicators:** Admins can filter by chats that have received negative feedback, making them easy to identify and prioritize for review.
