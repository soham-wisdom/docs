## Best Practices when you see Negative Feedback

1. If the issue is just an incorrect SQL, you can fix the SQL and thumbs up the response.
2. If it is an understanding gap, which is generally applicable, then you should add a knowledge item.
3. If this is some kind of feedback on the WisdomAI product, contact [support@wisdom.ai](mailto:support@wisdom.ai).
