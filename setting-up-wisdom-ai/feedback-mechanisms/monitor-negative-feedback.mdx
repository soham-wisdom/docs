## Best Practices when you see Negative Feedback

1. If the issue is just an incorrect SQL, you can [edit it](/improve-wisdom-ai-responses/validate-and-test-answers#1-edit-the-sql-query) the response.
2. If it is an understanding gap, which is generally applicable, then you should [add knowledge to your Domain](/improve-wisdom-ai-responses/validate-and-test-answers#3-add-knowledge-context).
3. If this is some kind of feedback on the WisdomAI product, contact [support@askwisdom.ai](mailto:support@askwisdom.ai).

<Note>
For Domains with high usage or complex data, it is highly recommended to assign a dedicated administrator to regularly review feedback and make necessary updates to the knowledge base, ensuring continuous optimal performance.
