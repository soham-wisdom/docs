Administrators are responsible for reviewing and acting upon the negative feedback provided by all users. WisdomAI provides different options for this:

- **Accessing Feedback:** Administrators can view all negative feedback by navigating to the **Chat Log** tab within the WisdomAI interface.
- **Visual Indicators:** Admins can filter by chats that have received negative feedback, making them easy to identify and prioritize for review.
- **Email Notifications:** The system automatically channels negative feedback to administrators via email, ensuring prompt attention to issues that require intervention.

  <Info>
    This is a Beta feature, reach out support at [support@askwisdom.ai](mailto:support@askwisdom.ai) to sign up for email notifications when negative feedback is submitted.
  </Info>
- **Prioritization for Improvement:** Questions marked with negative feedback are automatically prioritized for knowledge base improvement.
- **Dedicated Administration:** For Domains with high usage or complex data, it is highly recommended to assign a dedicated administrator to regularly review feedback and make necessary updates to the knowledge base, ensuring continuous optimal performance.
