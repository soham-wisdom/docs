In WisdomAI, what you may know as dashboards are called **Stories**. Stories allow you to present curated insights in a clear, structured, and visually appealing format to help stakeholders make informed decisions.

<Note>
  If you are looking for help on how to turn chat answers into Stories, we cover that in a dedicated article: [Turn Answers into Stories](/using-wisdom-ai-everyday/turn-answers-into-stories).

This guide will walk you through the next steps after your answers are ready to be showcased, including:

- [Explore the Stories Editor](#explore-the-stories-editor)
- [Arrange Story Layouts](#arrange-story-layouts)
- [Export Your Story](#export-your-story)
- [Gather Stakeholder Sign-Off](#gather-stakeholder-sign-off)

## Explore the Stories Editor

Once your analysis is complete and you have turned answers into cards (see the [Turn Answers into Stories](#) article), the **Stories** section becomes your central workspace. Here, you can refine the presentation of your insights, build out full dashboards, and prepare content for sharing.

The Stories Editor includes features such as:

- An **Executive Summary** for setting context at the top of your Story.
- An **Add widget** option to insert charts, tables, text blocks, and more.
- A **Filters** pane for interactive data exploration.
- Tools to manage layout, export, and share your Story effectively.

## Arrange Your Story Layout

Make your Story both visually compelling and logically structured:

- **Add widgets directly from the Story interface.** Create visualizations or text widgets that communicate key takeaways. This action launches a chat interface where you can generate the content based on your data.


- **Move cards** **around the workspace** to arrange their order based on importance, logical flow, or stakeholder preference.
- **Group related cards** to create thematic sections within your Story (e.g., “Monthly Revenue Trends,” “Top Performing Reps,” “Churn Metrics”).
- **Resize and reformat** cards to emphasize key metrics and insights, ensuring your visuals match the narrative flow.

<Tip>
  A well-structured layout helps stakeholders grasp patterns faster and ask more meaningful follow-up questions.

When you are satisfied with your layout, click **Save** to preserve your changes. You can always return later to iterate.

## Export Your Story

After arranging your Story, you might want to share it outside the platform. WisdomAI supports multiple export options:

- **PDF Export:** Ideal for sharing in meetings, emailing to leadership, or archiving.
- **Image Snapshot:** Useful for presentations or embedding in slide decks.
- **Link Sharing:** Generate a shareable link with customizable access permissions (e.g., team only, organization-wide, public).

To export:

1. Open the completed Story.
2. Click the **Export** button in the upper-right corner.
3. Choose your preferred export format and follow the prompts.

## Gather Stakeholder Sign-Off

Before finalizing your Story for broader distribution or operational use, it’s important to obtain approval from key stakeholders. This ensures the information is accurate, aligned with business goals, and ready to guide decisions.

Here is a suggested flow:

1. **Share the Story link** with stakeholders (use organization-only access for privacy).
2. **Add context**: summarize what the Story includes and the decisions it’s intended to support.
3. **Collect feedback** directly within the platform or through async tools (Slack, email).
4. **Incorporate edits** based on feedback, then **mark the Story as final** or version it for future iterations.

<Tip>
  Keeping track of who has reviewed and approved the Story helps streamline communication and build trust in the data.
