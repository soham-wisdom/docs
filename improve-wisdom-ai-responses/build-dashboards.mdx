What you may know as dashboards, in WisdomAI are called **Dashboards**. Dashboards allow you to present curated insights in a clear, structured, and visually appealing format that you can arrange and share.

<Note>
  If you are looking for help on how to turn chat answers into Dashboards, read the article [Turn Answers into Dashboards](/using-wisdom-ai-everyday/turn-answers-into-stories).
</Note>

This guide will walk you through the following steps after your answers are ready to be showcased, including:

- [Explore the Dashboards Editor](#explore-the-stories-editor)
- [Arrange Dashboard Layout](#arrange-story-layout)
- [Get Stakeholders Sign-Off](#get-stakeholders-sign-off)
- [Export your Dashboard](#export-your-story)

## Explore the Dashboards Editor

Once your analysis is complete and you have turned answers into cards (see the [Turn Answers into Dashboards](/using-wisdom-ai-everyday/turn-answers-into-stories) article), the **Dashboards** section becomes your central workspace. Here, you can refine the presentation of your insights, build out full dashboards, and prepare content for sharing.

The Dashboards Editor includes features such as:

1. A collapsible **Overview** section that includes:
   - An **Executive Summary** for setting context at the top of your Dashboard.
   - A data summary for **what's changed since** a specific date, such as yesterday, last week, etc.
2. An option to **add** a **widget**  directly from the Dashboard interface. Create **Visualization** or **Text** widgets that communicate key takeaways.

   <Info>
     The **Visualization** option opens a chat interface that helps you generate visual content based on your data. In contrast, the **Text** option opens an MDX editor to add narrative or explanatory content.

3. A **Filters** pane for interactive data exploration.
4. An option to **share** your Dashboard effectively.

## Arrange Dashboard Layout

Make your Dashboard both visually compelling and logically structured:

- **Move Dashboards cards around the workspace** to arrange them in order by importance, logical flow, or stakeholder preference.
- **Group related cards** to create thematic Dashboards (e.g., “Monthly Revenue Trends,” “Top Performing Reps,” “Churn Metrics”).
- [**Edit the answers to Dashboards cards**](/improve-wisdom-ai-responses/validate-and-test-answers) to emphasize key metrics and insights, ensuring your visuals match the narrative flow.

<Tip>
  A well-structured layout helps stakeholders grasp patterns faster and ask more meaningful follow-up questions.
</Tip>

All changes are saved automatically as you work. You can always return to the Dashboard later to iterate.

## Get Stakeholders Sign-Off

Before finalizing your Dashboard for broader distribution or operational use, it is essential to obtain approval from key stakeholders. This ensures the information is accurate, aligned with business goals, and ready to guide decisions.

Here is a suggested flow:

1. [**Share the Dashboard link**](/using-wisdom-ai-everyday/share-stories-and-set-access-control) with stakeholders.
2. **Add context**: summarize what the Dashboard includes and the decisions it is intended to support.
3. **Collect feedback** directly within the platform or through async tools (Slack, email).
4. **Incorporate edits** based on feedback, then tag the Dashboard as final or rename it for future iterations.

<Tip>
  Keeping track of who has reviewed and approved the Dashboard helps streamline communication and build trust in the data.
</Tip>

## Export your Dashboard

Once you are satisfied with your layout and stakeholders have approved it, you may want to **share** it or **schedule notifications** to keep stakeholders and explorers informed. Both topics are covered in related articles.
