## View and Navigate Chat History

The **Chat Log** interface provides robust functionalities for viewing and tracking the history of your team's interactions, contributing to transparency and content reliability. The system maintains a comprehensive, chronological record of all communications.

- **Chat Summary:** Offers a concise overview or the initial query of the interaction.
- **Response Count:** Displays the number of responses within a chat, indicating the depth of the conversation. Accompanying icons (e.g., üí¨ 1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1) provide additional context on interaction types.

3. **Filter** and locate **interactions**. Users can efficiently locate specific historical interactions using various filtering options to streamline their review process:

- **Date Range Filtering:** Utilize "Start Date" and "End Date" fields to constrain the view to a specific timeframe, allowing for targeted historical review.
- **User-Specific Filtering:** Filter by user to display only chats associated with a particular team member, enabling focused review of individual contributions.
- **Domain-Specific Filtering:** Restrict entries to a selected domain or topic, facilitating the review of domain-specific discussions.
- **Keyword Search:** Employ the "Filter by summary" field to search for specific keywords or phrases within chat summaries, enhancing discoverability.
- **Filter Reset:** The "Clear Filters" button allows for quick removal of all active filters, restoring the full log view.

- **Identify User Contributions:** Within the detailed view, individual user contributions are clearly demarcated, aiding in accountability and tracing the origin of specific information.

### Share Vetted Answers from the Chat Log

The Chat Log also allows you to review past interactions, including refined answers and AI-generated insights, open your chat window, and share these interactions with other users or your entire organization. This ensures that valuable, vetted responses are easily disseminated and accessible.

Follow these actions to share vetted answers from the Chat Log:
