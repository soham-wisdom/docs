When working with data-driven systems, it is not enough to simply receive an answer. You need to ensure that the information is accurate, relevant, and reliable. For this reason, you can test and validate both natural language responses and SQL query results directly within the chat interface as well as review the generated output, provide feedback using thumbs up or thumbs down, and edit or vet the SQL query when necessary. These features help you iterate efficiently and build confidence in the outputs you receive.

## Validate Answers

While using the chatbot, you can train it by validating or disproving answers and provide feedback to trigger a revision. There are three main ways to do so:

- **Using the thumbs up/down icons**
- **By editing the response**
- **By fine-tuning the Context**

### Use the thumbs up/down icons to provide feedback

If your feedback was thumbs down, a new window opens to let you adjust the query accordingly . The more thumbs up/down you provide, the more you will be training the tool to get a high quality correct answer.

### Edit the Response

1. Click on the **Edit** button available for Admins in the chat interface to modify the SQL query that the chatbot generated and make other adjustments such as editing the columns and the general table format. Using this Editor allows you to correct any inaccuracies in the SQL and ensure it accurately answers the intended question.

In the window that opens, you will find the Editor and the SQL tabs.

#### Editor Tab

This Editor tab offers detailed data visualization configuration:

- **Chart Type Selection:** Utilize the dropdown menu to choose the desired visual representation. (e.g., "Line chart")
- **Chart/Table Configuration:** Drag-and-drop data columns to include in the chart, in this example, a Line Chart with X and Y Axes (e.g., "Region" for categorization, "Total Revenue SUM" for aggregation).
- **Data Filtering:** Apply specific criteria (e.g., "Stage Label: Closed Won") for precise data segmentation.
- **Changes Management:**  The Apply changes button commits configurations, while the Reset one reverts them.

#### SQL Code Tab

Users can directly define and manipulate the underlying data for visualizations by interacting with the SQL code.

- **SQL Editor:** Craft and modify SQL statements to precisely define your dataset. This includes selecting columns, applying aggregations (e.g., SUM, AVG), joining multiple tables, filtering data with `WHERE` clauses, and ordering results.
- **Workflow Management:**
  - **Execution & Refresh:** Click the **Update response** button to execute the current SQL query and refresh the associated data visualization with the newly retrieved results.

- **Review & Validation:**
  1. Select **Mark as reviewed** to confirms that the SQL code has been validated or checked, streamlining collaborative workflows.
  2. After selecting this option, the **Review Question** window opens where you can add the title of your question.
  3. Once ready, click on Confirm.

This Reviewed Query will become available within the Domain section.

### Fine-tune the Context

Within the Domains \> B2B Sales \> Knowledge \> Context section, you can add or modify domain-specific knowledge and information in natural language sentences. This helps the system understand your business context and formulate more precise queries. For example, you can define terms like "Regions are same as Territories" or clarify "My sales stages are: Prospect, Negotiation, Closed." This direct manipulation of the context allows you to guide the chatbot's understanding and improve its ability to generate relevant SQL queries.

In all these cases, the system will use the provided data to adjust the context of your database, modelling it further, and making it possible to provide better answers in a future search.

## Test Answers

After validating a chat response, the system may offer the option to retry the answer while incorporating your adjustments or you can send a new input. These adjustments will also remain valid and may be applied to future queries to improve accuracy and consistency.
