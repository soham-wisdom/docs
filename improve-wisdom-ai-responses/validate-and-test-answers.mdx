title: "Validate and Test Answers"
---

This guide is for Administrators responsible for ensuring the accuracy of WisdomAI responses. This workflow typically begins after an end-user [provides negative feedback on an answer](/setting-up-wisdom-ai/feedback-mechanisms/provide-feedback-to-the-system).

Here, you will learn how to edit, test, and validate responses to build confidence and improve the system's knowledge base.

## Prerequisites

- You must have **Administrator** permissions. For details, see [Access Management](/manage-account/access-management).

## 1. Edit the SQL Query

When an answer is incorrect, you can directly edit the underlying SQL query.

1. Click the **Edit** button on the answer card in the chat interface.

  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"95%" }}
/>

2. The **Editor** window will open. Go to the **SQL Code** tab.
4. Modify the SQL statement to fix inaccuracies, add joins, or correct filters.
5. Click **Update response** to run the revised query and refresh the data.
5. (Optional) Switch back to the **Editor** tab to configure chart types, add filters, or drag-and-drop columns for visualization.

## 2. Test the Updated Answer

After editing the query, you must test the new response.

- **Retry with Adjustments:** Use the **Retry** option in the chat window to have the system regenerate the response using your new SQL.
- **Cross-Reference:** Validate the new result by cross-referencing it with a known value or an external report.
- **Test for Accuracy:** Try rephrasing the original question in a few different ways (e.g., "revenue by region" vs. "how much did each territory earn?"). If the system doesn't return the correct answer, you may need to [Add Knowledge](#3-add-knowledge-context) to help it with precise queries.

## 3. Add Knowledge (Context)

If the system consistently misunderstands terms, you can add explicit context. This helps the system formulate more precise queries.

1. Navigate to **Domains** \> (Select your Domain) \> **Knowledge** \> **Context** and click **Add Context**.
3. Add natural language sentences to define business terms.
   - _Example 1:_ `Regions are the same as Territories.`
   - _Example 2:_ `My sales stages are: Prospect, Negotiation, Closed.`
4. Click **SAVE**.

## 4. Mark the Answer as Reviewed

Once you have confirmed the SQL is correct and the answer is accurate, save it to the system's knowledge base.

1. From the **SQL Code** tab in the **Editor** window, click **Mark as reviewed**.
2. In the **Review Question** window, add a clear title for the question (e.g., "Official Quarterly Revenue by Region").
3. Click **Confirm**.

This action saves the question and its validated SQL as a [Validated Query](/setting-up-wisdom-ai/feedback-mechanisms/reviewed-queries), which serves as a trusted reference for similar future questions.

To ensure that the information provided in the answer is accurate, relevant, and reliable, you can:

- Test and validate both natural language responses and SQL query results directly within the chat interface.
- Review the generated output by providing feedback.
- Edit or vet the SQL query when necessary.

These features help you iterate efficiently and build confidence in the outputs you receive.
