title: "Use Files to Improve Responses"

You can attach a file to your WisdomAI chat to provide additional context for the session. This feature allows WisdomAI to use the information within the file to understand and respond better to your queries, acting as a temporary knowledge base for the duration of your conversation.

## How it Works

To attach a file to your chat session, follow these steps:

1. In your chat session, click the **Upload File** icon.
2. Select your file, and ensure it is a supported file type.
3. Add your query in the chat, and click **Send**.

WisdomAI will then process the file's content and use it as a reference for your questions.

This allows for a more fluid and intuitive interaction, especially when dealing with complex data tasks. For example, you could upload a screenshot of a bar chart and ask WisdomAI to generate a similar chart using the dataset of the Domain you are using.

## Supported File Types

WisdomAI currently supports a variety of file types, including images, documents, and different text formats. See the following list:

- **Images**
  - .png
  - .jpeg
  - .webp
- **Documents**
  - .pdf
- **Text Files**
  - Any file with a text/\* MIME type
  - .json
  - .lkml
  - .md (Markdown)
  - .log
  - .yml
  - .yaml

<Note>
  The maximum file size you can upload is 20MB.
