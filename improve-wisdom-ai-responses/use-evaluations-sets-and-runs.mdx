title: "Use Evaluations Sets and Runs"
---

**Evaluation Sets** and **Evaluation Runs** are crucial for rigorously testing and validating the performance of your domain's AI, ensuring it consistently generates accurate and relevant responses.

## Evaluation Sets

Evaluation Sets allow you to create specific sets of prompts that simulate user interactions. A key feature is the ability to provide expected SQL outputs alongside these prompts. This direct comparison helps measure the AI's accuracy in translating natural language into correct database queries.

To create an Evaluation Set:

1. Open a Domain and click on the **Evaluation** tab.
2. Navigate to the **Evaluation Sets** Sub-tab.
3. Click **Add Evaluation**.

4. Fill out the **Add Evaluation** Form, providing a set **Name** and an array of prompts in JSON format, optionally including the expected SQL.

   <Tip>
     The array you provide defines how many conversations will be created. Each _top-level element_ in the array represents a conversation:

     ✔ If it's a string or an object → You get a single-message conversation\
     ✔ If it's an array → You create a multi-message conversation

     For example, this input:\
     `["prompt1", ["prompt2.1", "prompt2.2"], "prompt3"]`\
     creates **3 conversations**: the first and third with one message each, and the second with two messages.

     You can structure the arrays in any way, mixing single and multi-message conversations as required.
   </Tip>
5. Click on **Save**. The new Evaluation set will appear listed.

## Evaluation Runs

**Evaluation Runs** are where the AI processes your defined Evaluation Sets. After running these evaluations, you can review the results to identify areas for improvement.

To Run an Evaluation, go to the Evaluations Set tab, select an evaluation and click on **Run**. You will see the results in the Evaluation Runs tab.
