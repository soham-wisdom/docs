title: "Access Management"
---

We use **role-based access control (RBAC)** to ensure users have the permissions they need for their jobs. In an RBAC model, each user is assigned one or more roles, and each role bundles a set of capabilities. Our tool also implements **granular access controls** (including row- and column-level security) to protect data. This ensures that team members access only the information they need to do their job.

## Core Roles in WisdomAI

Every operation in WisdomAI, from viewing dashboards to managing data sources, falls under these role-based permissions:

- [Administrator](#administrator)
- [Data Administrator](#data-administrator)
- [Explorer](#explorer)
- [Observer](#observer)

### Administrator

The Administrator is the superuser of the WisdomAI platform with full system-wide privileges. Administrators are responsible for the foundational setup and governance of the organization. They can:

- **Manage users and roles**: Invite or remove users, assign or modify roles, and oversee access permissions.
- **Manage Domains**: Configure and maintain organizational Domains within WisdomAI.
- **Connect and organize data**: Link external data sources, manage schemas (i.e., the structure of tables and relationships), and context import, which ingests business rules and data dictionaries.
- **Oversee your organization's content**: Review, publish, or unpublish key assets like stories and models to control visibility and access.
- **Monitor and audit activity**: Track system usage, access logs, and platform health metrics to ensure smooth operation.

<Info>
  Every WisdomAI instance must have at least one Administrator.
</Info>

### Data Administrator

The Data Administrator manages and prepares data assets within specific Domains. They do not have global system permissions, but can:

- **Connect Domain-level data**: Set up and configure data sources for their assigned Domains.
- **Model business context**: Define metrics, entities, and relationships relevant to their Domain.
- **Manage content**: Create and maintain Dashboards and Domain-specific assets, as well as manage access to Dashboards and Reports.
- **Apply data policies**: Set row-level and column-level access rules and validation policies.
- **Collaborate with Explorers**: Ensure data is usable, discoverable, and tailored to user needs.

<Info>
  Data Administrators cannot manage users and roles.
</Info>

### Explorer

Explorers are data consumers. They use WisdomAI to explore, analyze, and interact with data through stories and chat. They can:

- **Ask questions**: Use natural language chat to query data.
- **Leverage enterprise context**: Access and utilize organizational knowledge directly within the chat to ground responses in business-specific logic.
- **Explore Dashboards**: View and interact with published Dashboards and Dashboards.
- **Share insights**: Export results to Slack or email and share findings with others.
- **Save views**: Bookmark visualizations or findings for later use.
- **Access Reports**: View and interact with published reports (Access to Reports).

<Info>
  Explorers cannot manage data sources, users, or settings.
</Info>

### Observer

The Observer role provides "read-only" access to the platform. This role is ideal for stakeholders who need to see high-level results without interacting with the underlying data or creating new content.

- **Read-only access**: View published Dashboards and Reports.
- **No Resource Creation**: Cannot create dashboards, stories, or data models.
- **No Chat Interaction**: Cannot use the natural language chat to query data.

<Info>
  **Seat Usage:** You can have an unlimited number of Observers in WisdomAI; they do not count against your organization's total seat limit.
