title: "Access Management"
---

We use **role-based access control (RBAC)** to ensure users have the right permissions for their job. In an RBAC model, each user is assigned one or more roles, and each role bundles a set of capabilities. This ensures that team members access only the information they need to do their job.

Our tool also implements **granular access controls** (including row- and column-level security) to protect data. Every operation in WisdomAI, from viewing dashboards to managing data sources, falls under these role-based permissions:

- [Administrator](#administrator)
- [Data Administrator](#data-administrator)
- [Explorer](#explorer)

## Core Roles in WisdomAI

### Administrator

The **Administrator** is the superuser of the WisdomAI platform with full system-wide privileges. Administrators are responsible for the foundational setup and governance of the workspace.

They can:

- **Manage users and roles**: Invite or remove users, assign or modify roles, and oversee access permissions.
- **Manage Domains**: Configure and maintain organizational domains within WisdomAI.
- **Connect and organize data**: Link external data sources, manage schemas (i.e., the structure of tables and relationships), and maintain core metadata.
- **Oversee workspace content**: Review, publish, or unpublish key assets like stories and models to control visibility and access.
- **Monitor and audit activity**: Track system usage, access logs, and platform health metrics to ensure smooth operation.

<Info>
  Every WisdomAI instance must have at least one Administrator.

### Data Administrator

The **Data Administrator** manages and prepares data assets within specific Domains. They do not have global system permissions but can:

- **Connect Domain-level data**: Set up and configure data sources for their assigned Domains.
- **Model business context**: Define metrics, entities, and relationships relevant to their Domain.
- **Manage content**: Create and maintain Stories, Playbooks, and Domain-specific assets as well as manage access to Dashboards and Reports.
- **Apply data policies**: Set row-level and column-level access rules and validation policies.
- **Collaborate with Explorers**: Ensure data is usable, discoverable, and tailored to user needs.

<Info>
  Data Administrators cannot manage users and roles.

### Explorer

**Explorers** are data consumers. They use WisdomAI to explore, analyze, and interact with data through stories and chat. They can:

- **Ask questions**: Use natural language chat to query data.
- **Explore stories**: View and interact with published stories and dashboards.
- **Use playbooks**: Run and reuse automated data workflows.
- **Share insights**: Export and share results with others.
- **Save views**: Bookmark visualizations or findings for later use.
- **Access Reports**: View and interact with published reports (Access to Reports).
- **Knowledge Management**: Access and utilize knowledge within the platform.

<Info>
  Explorers cannot manage data sources, users, or settings.
