## Access Management in WisdomAI

WisdomAI uses **role-based access control (RBAC)** to ensure users have the right permissions for their job. In an RBAC model, each user is assigned one or more roles, and each role bundles a set of capabilities. This ensures that team members access only the information they need to do their job.

WisdomAI implements **granular access controls** (including row- and column-level security) to protect data. Every operation in WisdomAI, from viewing dashboards to managing data sources, falls under these role-based permissions:

- [Administrator](#administrator)
- [Data Administrator](#data-administrator)
- [Explorer](#explorer)

## Core Roles in WisdomAI

### Administrator

The **Administrator** is the superuser of the WisdomAI platform with full system-wide privileges. Administrators are responsible for the foundational setup and governance of the workspace.

They can:

- **Manage users and roles**: Invite or remove users, assign or modify roles, and oversee access permissions.
- **Connect and organize data**: Link external data sources, manage schemas (i.e., the structure of tables and relationships), and maintain core metadata.
- **Oversee workspace content**: Review, publish, or unpublish key assets like stories and models to control visibility and access.
- **Monitor and audit activity**: Track system usage, access logs, and platform health metrics to ensure smooth operation.

<Info>
  Every WisdomAI instance must have at least one Administrator.

### Data Administrator

The **Data Administrator** manages and prepares data assets within specific domains. They do not have global system permissions but can:

- Connect and configure data sources for assigned domains.
- Create and maintain business context models (like metrics, entities, and relationships).
- Create and manage Stories, Playbooks, and data assets.
- Define data validation rules and row-level/column-level policies within their domain.
- Collaborate with Explorers to ensure data accessibility and relevance.

### Explorer

**Explorers** are data consumers. They use WisdomAI to explore, analyze, and interact with data through stories and chat. They can:

- Ask questions using natural language chat.
- View and interact with published stories and dashboards.
- Run and reuse playbooks.
- Export and share insights.
- Save personal bookmarks and visualizations.

> Explorers cannot manage data sources, users, or settings.

## Summary

WisdomAI’s RBAC framework ensures that everyone — from platform admins to business users — gets access to the right capabilities. This structure enhances security, governance, and collaboration by separating responsibilities cleanly across three key roles.
