## Access Management in WisdomAI

WisdomAI uses **role-based access control (RBAC)** to ensure users have the right permissions for their job. In an RBAC model, each user is assigned one or more roles, and each role bundles a set of capabilities. This ensures that team members access only the information they need to do their job.

WisdomAI implements **granular access controls** (including row- and column-level security) to protect data and enforce policy. Every operation in WisdomAI, from viewing dashboards to managing data sources, is controlled by these role-based permissions.

## Core Roles in WisdomAI

### Administrator

The **Administrator** is the superuser of the WisdomAI platform with full system-wide privileges. Administrators can:

- **Manage users and roles:** Invite/remove users, assign/change roles, manage teams/groups.
- **Configure security and settings:** Define global security rules, SSO/SCIM, and policies.
- **Manage data sources and schemas:** Connect data sources, define schemas and metadata.
- **Oversee content and assets:** Publish/unpublish dashboards, stories, models.
- **Monitor and audit activity:** Access system-wide logs, metrics, and health checks.

> 📝 Note: Every WisdomAI instance must have at least one Administrator.

### 📊 Data Administrator

The **Data Administrator** manages and prepares data assets within specific domains. They do not have global system permissions but can:

- Connect and configure data sources for assigned domains.
- Create and maintain business context models (like metrics, entities, and relationships).
- Create and manage stories, playbooks, and data assets.
- Define data validation rules and row-level/column-level policies within their domain.
- Collaborate with Explorers to ensure data accessibility and relevance.

### 🔍 Explorer

**Explorers** are data consumers. They use WisdomAI to explore, analyze, and interact with data through stories and chat. They can:

- Ask questions using natural language chat.
- View and interact with published stories and dashboards.
- Run and reuse playbooks.
- Export and share insights.
- Save personal bookmarks and visualizations.

> Explorers cannot manage data sources, users, or settings.
