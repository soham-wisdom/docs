This article will guide Administrators through effective user management within WisdomAI, focusing on how to invite new users and assign permissions carefully based on user responsibilities, leveraging WisdomAI's role-based access control to ensure secure and appropriate data access.

## Invite Users

As an administrator, you can invite additional users to your WisdomAI environment:

1. Navigate to **Users** \> **Invite Users**. The Invite Users modal window will open.
