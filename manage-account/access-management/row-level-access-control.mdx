title: "Row Level Access Control"
---

Row-Level Access Control (RLAC), often referred to as Row-Level Security (RLS), is a data security feature that allows for granular control over data access within the platform. Instead of simply granting or denying access to an entire table or column, **RLAC enables administrators to define policies that restrict which specific rows of data a user or group can view or manipulate**. The security logic is applied directly at the data source, meaning that no matter how the data is accessed (e.g., through a dashboard, report, or direct query), the row-level filters are enforced automatically.

This capability facilitates:

- **Implementing fine-grained data segregation:** Ensuring that sensitive data is isolated and only accessible to authorized individuals or teams.
- **Enhancing data privacy and compliance:** Meeting regulatory requirements (like GDPR, HIPAA) by controlling who can see personal or confidential information.
- **Creating personalized data views:** Allowing different users to interact with the same underlying data model, but only seeing the relevant subset of information pertinent to their role or responsibilities.

## How to Set Up Row-Level Authorization

1. Navigate to the Data tab, click the three-dot menu next to the desired table, and select "Row Level Authz".

2. To create the master permission list, choose to configure the table as an "index table".

3. Set the "Email column" to the column that contains user emails for row-level authorization.

4. Set the "Internal ID column" to the column with the unique identifier used to filter other tables and save.

5. For the data table you want to restrict, open its "Row Level Authz" settings.

6. Choose to configure this table as a "filtered table".

7. Select the "Index Table" you previously configured so it appears in the dropdown.

8. Select the "Internal Column" that will join with the Index Tableâ€™s Internal Column.

9. Click on save to keep your changes.

## Key Considerations

- **Data Admins** bypass all restrictions and can view all data, while **Explorers** will always see filtered views.
- The system works best when user emails in your data match Wisdom user emails, though it can handle some variations.
- For filtering to work, the index table and filtered tables must be joinable on their respective ID columns.
- The table embedded RAG solution is not currently filtered by RLA, meaning all users may see all indexed results.
