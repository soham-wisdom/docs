title: "Row Level Access Control"
---

Row-Level Access Control (RLAC), often referred to as Row-Level Security (RLS), is a data security feature that allows for granular control over data access within the platform. Instead of simply granting or denying access to an entire table or column, **RLAC enables administrators to define policies that restrict which specific rows of data a user or group can view or manipulate**. The security logic is applied directly at the data source, meaning that no matter how the data is accessed (e.g., through a dashboard, report, or direct query), the row-level filters are enforced automatically.

## Set Up Row-Level Authorization

The setup process involves two key steps:

1. [**Configure an index table:**](#configure-an-index-table) Think of this as your master permission list.
   - **Email column:** Select the column that contains the email addresses of your users. This is used to identify who is currently logged in.
   - **Internal ID column:** Select the column that will act as the "key" to unlock data (e.g., a `UserID`, `GroupID`, or `RegionID`).
2. [**Configure a filtered table:**](#configure-a-filtered-table) This is the actual data you want to restrict.
   - **Index Table:** Choose the master permission list (index table) you just configured.
   - **Internal ID column:** Select the column in this table whose values will be matched against the "key" from your index table. This ensures users only see rows that correspond to their ID.

### Configure an Index Table

First, designate a table to act as the master list that maps your users to the data they are allowed to see; i.e.: configure the Index Table.

1. Within the selected Domain, Navigate to the **Data Sources** tab > **Tables**.
2. On the row you want to manage access control, click the three-dot menu next to the desired table, and select **Row Level Authz**.

3. In the modal that opens, choose the **Configure as index table** option to create the master permission list.
4. Set the **Email column** to the column that contains user emails for row-level authorization.
5. Set the **Internal ID column** to the column with the unique identifier used to filter other tables.
6. Click on **Save** to keep your changes.

### Configure a Filtered Table

Next, apply this configuration by selecting the created Index table and the internal column that these users will have access to; i.e.: set up the Filtered table.

1. For the data table you want to restrict, open its **Row Level Authz** settings (as shown in steps 1 and 2 before).
2. In the modal window that opens, choose the **configure** **as a filtered table** option.
3. From the dropdown menu, select the **Index Table** you have previously configured.
4. Select the **Internal Column** that will join with the Index Tableâ€™s Internal Column.
5. Click on **Save** to keep your changes.

## Key Considerations

- **Data Admins** bypass all restrictions and can view all data, while **Explorers** will always see filtered views.
- The system works best when user emails in your data match Wisdom user emails, though it can handle some variations.
- For filtering to work, the index table and filtered tables must be joinable on their respective ID columns.
- The table embedded RAG solution is not currently filtered by RLA, meaning all users may see all indexed results.
