Row-Level Access Control (RLAC), often referred to as Row-Level Security (RLS), is a powerful data security feature that allows for granular control over data access within a database or data platform. Instead of simply granting or denying access to an entire table or column, **RLAC enables administrators to define policies that restrict which specific rows of data a user or group can view or manipulate**. The security logic is applied directly at the data source, meaning that no matter how the data is accessed (e.g., through a dashboard, report, or direct query), the row-level filters are enforced automatically.

This capability facilitates:

- **Implementing fine-grained data segregation:** Ensuring that sensitive data is isolated and only accessible to authorized individuals or teams.
- **Enhancing data privacy and compliance:** Meeting regulatory requirements (like GDPR, HIPAA) by controlling who can see personal or confidential information.
- **Creating personalized data views:** Allowing different users to interact with the same underlying data model, but only seeing the relevant subset of information pertinent to their role or responsibilities.
