title: "How to Configure Row-Level Security"
---

This guide walks you through the step-by-step process of configuring Row-Level Security (RLS) filters in WisdomAI to control which rows of data users can access.

For a detailed explanation of RLS concepts, functions, and best practices, please see our [**Understanding Row-Level Security**](/manage-account/row-level-access-control/understanding-row-level-security) guide.

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have:

- Admin access to your WisdomAI domain.
- A clear understanding of the table you want to secure.
- (Optional) User attributes or entitlement tables already set up for dynamic filtering.

## Configure RLS on a Table

Find below the steps to configure row-level security for a table in your WisdomAI domain.

### 1. Open the RLS Configuration

1. In your WisdomAI domain, go to the **Tables** tab and locate the table you want to secure.
3. Click the three-dot menu on the right side of the row and select **Row-Level Security**.
4. The **Row-Level Security Configuration** modal screen opens.

### 2. Define the SQL Filter

1. In **Describe Filters**, optionally enter a short description of your security requirement (for documentation purposes).
2. In the **SQL** text box, enter the `WHERE` clause that defines which rows are visible.
3. You can use Wisdomâ€™s built-in functions for dynamic, user-aware filtering. For a complete list of functions and examples, see [Dynamic Filters with Custom Functions](/manage-account/row-level-access-control/understanding-row-level-security) in our guide to understanding RLS.
4. Optionally, you can check the **Set as entitlements table** option. This help you define which users can access which resources. To learn more about the core concepts behind entitlements tables, refer to the [Understanding Row-Level Security](/manage-account/row-level-access-control/understanding-row-level-security) guide.

### 3. Preview the Filter

1. Click **Preview**.
2. In the **Preview Table with Row-Level Security** modal, enter the email of a user in the **User Email** field.
3. Click **Impersonate** to see how the table appears for that user.
4. (Optional) Add temporary custom user attributes in the preview for advanced testing.

### 4. Save the Configuration

1. When the filter behaves as expected, click **Save** to apply it.
2. The filter will now be automatically added to all queries involving this table.
3. To disable RLS on a table, clear the SQL text box and save again.

## Optional Adjustments

For more advanced use cases, refer to the [**Understanding Row-Level Security**](https://www.google.com/search?q=/row-level-security) guide to learn about:

- **Applying RLS to Admin Users**: By default, admins bypass RLS. You can change this behavior in the domain's **Advanced** tab.
- **Using Entitlement Tables**: For complex permission models, you can use an entitlements table to manage access.
