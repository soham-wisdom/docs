title: "Role Mapping & SSO Groups"

Once users are provisioned via SSO, you can automate their permission levels by mapping Identity Provider (IdP) data to WisdomAI roles.

### Role Management through SCIM

When SCIM is enabled, your existing SSO groups are automatically detected and synced to Wisdom.

- **View Synced Groups**: Navigate to the **SSO Groups** list in the SSO Configuration settings to see groups like "Engineering" or "Sales" along with their sync status.

- **Assign Roles to Groups**: Use the **Add SSO Group** button to link a synced group to a specific WisdomAI role (e.g., Explorer).

  </Frame>

<Note>
  Any user belonging to that SSO group will automatically inherit the assigned roles and domain permissions in WisdomAI.
</Note>

### Role Management through Claims

If you prefer not to use SCIM groups, you can configure roles based on "claims" within the IDP's JSON Web Token (JWT).

<Tip>
  Contact [WisdomAI support](/manage-account/contact-support) to enable claims-based role management for your instance.
</Tip>

**How the Mapping Works:**

1. When a user logs in, WisdomAI reads a specific claim from the JWT (typically named `roles` or `groups`) which contains a list of strings.
2. An **SSO Group** in WisdomAI acts as a bridge. It maps a specific **string element** from that JWT list to the assigned **WisdomAI Role**.
3. If a user’s JWT contains the string `"marketing_admin"`, and you have created an SSO Group in Wisdom that maps `"marketing_admin"` to the **Explorer** role, that user is automatically granted those permissions.

**Setting it Up:**

- Click the **Add Group** button.
- In the **Add SSO Group** modal that opens, enter the string element that matches your IDP claim in the **SSO Group Name** field.

  <Info>
    The claim should be a list of strings.
  </Info>
- **Role Assignments**: Select the Role (e.g., Explorer) and the corresponding Domains to be mapped to that string.
- Click **Create User Group** to finalize the mapping.

### Auto SSO Group Generation

To avoid manual mapping entirely, WisdomAI can auto-generate groups based on a specific string schema in your IdP claims.

<Tip>
  Contact [WisdomAI support](/manage-account/contact-support) to enable claims-based role management for your instance.
</Tip>

Each claim string must follow this schema:

`wisdom.[optional_workspace_uri].role.[optional_scope_type].[optional_scope]`

1. `wisdom.` prefix for namespace and versioning purposes
2. `optional workspace URI.` (default workspace if not given)
3. `role.` (one of administrator, data_administrator, explorer, observer)
4. `optional scope type.` (required if scope is given)
5. `optional scope` (required if scope type is given)

**Examples of valid claim strings:**

- `wisdom.explorer`: Assigns the Explorer role on all domains in the default workspace.
- `wisdom.foo.explorer`: Assigns the Explorer role on all domains within the "foo" workspace.
- `wisdom.explorer.DOMAIN.ET_DOMAIN_foo`: Assigns the Explorer role to a specific domain in the default workspace.
- `wisdom.foo.explorer.DOMAIN.ET_DOMAIN_bar`: Assigns the Explorer role on a specific domain in the foo workspace.
