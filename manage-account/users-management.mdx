title: "Manual User Management"

When Single Sign-On (SSO) is not enabled for your organization, users are managed manually through the **Users IAM page**. This article guides Administrators on how to invite users and assign permissions based on responsibilities.

## Invite Users

As an administrator, you can invite new users to join your WisdomAI environment via email.

1. Navigate to **Users** \> **Invite Users**. The Invite Users modal window will open.

2. Enter the **email address** of the person you want to invite.
3. Assign the appropriate **role** and the corresponding **Domain**.
   - You can assign more than one Role and Domain to a user.
   - To delete any record, click on the bin icon.
4. Click **Invite**.

<Warning>
  Assign roles carefully based on user responsibilities. Role-based access control ensures users only access the data and features they need.
</Warning>

## Assign Roles (Individual)

Roles may be managed on a per-user basis. Whether you need to add or change a user's role, you can do it from the users list.

1. Navigate to **Users** \> Find the user to assign/change the role, click on the kebab menu (three vertical dots) on its row, and select **Edit**. The Edit User modal window will open.

3. Click **Update**.

## Manage User Groups

You can also create groups with roles to streamline management. Users will inherit any roles from the groups they belong to.

1. Navigate to **Users \> Groups** and click **Add Group**.
2. In the **Add User Group** modal that opens, provide a name for the group (e.g., `example_group`).
3. Assign the **Role(s)** and **Domain(s)** that all group members should have.
4. Click **Create**.

5. Assign users to these groups via the **Edit User** modal. When a user is in a group, their profile will show roles as **Inherited from group**.
