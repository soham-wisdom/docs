This article will guide Administrators through effective user management within WisdomAI, focusing on how to invite new users and assign permissions carefully based on user responsibilities.

## Invite Users

As an administrator, you can invite additional users to your WisdomAI environment:

1. Navigate to **Users** \> **Invite Users**. The Invite Users modal window will open.

2. Enter the **email address** of the person you want to invite.
3. Assign the appropriate **role** and the corresponding **Domain**.
   - You can assign more than one Role and Domain to a user.
   - To delete any record, click on the bin icon.
4. Click **Invite**.

<Warning>
  Assign roles carefully based on user responsibilities. Role-based access control ensures users only access the data and features they need.
</Warning>

## Assign Roles

Whether you need to add or change a user's role, you can do it from the users list.

1. Navigate to **Users** \> Find the user to assign/change the role, click on the kebab menu (three vertical dots) on its row, and select **Edit**. The Edit User modal window will open.
