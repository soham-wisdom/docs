title: "Advanced Tutorial: Fine Tuning Your Context"
---

This tutorial is intended for:

- Admin users, who are in charge of configuring data sources and setting up the chatbot.
- Data Administrators, responsibles for configuring particular Domains.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Adjust and enrich the context used by Wisdom AI to better understand user queries.
- Manage and fine-tune data source connections at a detailed level.
- Match and map columns and fields across multiple data sources for consistency.
- Test and validate your adjustments to ensure the chatbot responds correctly.

Once you have completed this tutorial, you will have fine-tuned your data so the Wisdom AI chatbot can deliver more accurate and context-aware responses, improving its ability to analyze and interact with your data effectively.

## Before you Begin

To follow this tutorial, you should:

- Have Admin/Data Admin access to your Wisdom AI account. Read the <u>How to Request an Environment</u> guide to know more about it.
- Have read the <u>Basic Tutorial: Connect and Experiment</u> tutorial to learn how to **Connect to your Data Sources** and how to **create Domains**.
- Have already created at least one Domain.

## 

1. Navigate to the **Domain** tab in the left sidebar and open it.
2. Select the Domain you would like to fine-tune. In the window that opens, you will find the following tabs:
   - OVERVIEW: Find here a summary of key information and activity related to the dataset.
   - DATA SOURCES: This tab is where data administrators manage and model the raw data structure to make it queryable and insightful within the platform.
   - KNOWLEDGE: Define here domain-specific logic and terminology in natural language. In this section, you can fine-tune how the system interprets data by setting contextual rules, custom metrics, and named entities, ensuring responses align with your business's definitions and expectations.
   - ADVANCED: Configure here domain-level settings that affect AI behavior, display preferences, chat customization, and fiscal logic, among others.
   - EVALUATION: Test and validate here how the system interprets natural language queries by creating evaluation sets. This ensures your domain returns accurate, expected results by letting you input prompts (with or without the corresponding SQL) and assess how the AI responds.
