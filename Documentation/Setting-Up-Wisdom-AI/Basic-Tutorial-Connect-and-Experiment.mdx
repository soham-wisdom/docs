### Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Connect to your Database.
- Start experimenting with your Wisdom AI chatbot to test it.
- Provide feedback so the system can create context by itself.

### Intended Audience

This guide is intended for Admin users, responsible for configuring data sources and setting up the chatbot. Admins will play a key role in shaping how the chatbot begins to understand, respond, and evolve through feedback.

### Before you Begin

To follow this tutorial, you should:

- Have Admin access to your Wisdom AI account. Read the <u>How to Request an Environment</u> guide to know more about it.
- Know the location and credentials for your data source.
- Be familiar with basic database concepts (e.g., tables, fields, queries).

Once you have completed this tutorial, you will have a working chatbot connected to your data and ready to improve through real-time testing and feedback.

## Steps

### Connect to Data Sources

To get started, you first need to connect your existing data tools to Wisdom AI so the system can access and prepare your data for use.

1. Go to the left sidebar and click on **Connections**. A new page will open. There is where you will find all your connections listed, once established.
2. Click on the **Add Connection** button to start.

   <Note>
     This action lets you link your existing data tools to Wisdom AI. Doing so enables the system to scan metadata. For data warehouse connections, it also allows Wisdom AI to fetch data when users ask questions in natural language.
   </Note>
3. Add a **Connection name**. Make it representative so it is easy to identify among other connections.
4. Select the **Data Source** type (Supported ones are: Redshift, Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MySQL, Databricks). For more details, see the <u>Supported Data Sources</u> guide.
   1. Once selected, you will be able to populate the **Connection details** with your credentials: **Account**, **Warehouse**, **User**, **Role**, **Private Key**, and **Database Filters**.
5. After you have added your credentials, click on the **Save and Sync metadata** button.

### Select the Data

After you have added your data source, you will need to select what data you want to use in your project. For this, you will need to create a Domain.

1. Go to **Domains**, in the left side bar.

   <Note>
     A Domain represents a logical business area or function, such as "Sales," "Marketing," or "Finance." Creating well-defined domains makes data more accessible and relevant to business users.
   </Note>
2. Click on the **Add Domain** button. A new window will open.
3. Enter the **Domain name** and a **Description** for it.
4. **Select the database** from the dropdown menu. Once selected, the list of tables will be displayed.
5. Choose the \*\*tables \*\*that you would like to use and drag and drop them to the working area. To learn how to fine-tune your data, read the related guide <u>Advanced Tutorial: Fine Tuning Your Context.</u>
6. Click on **Save and continue**. You will now be ready to start testing your Wisdom AI chatbot.

### Start Experimenting

Once your data is set up and selected, you can begin experimenting with your Wisdom AI chatbot to see it in action and test its data analysis capabilities.

1. Navigate to the **Chat** tab in the left sidebar.
2. Ask **questions**  such as:
   1. _"What was our revenue by region last quarter?"_
   2. _"Show me customer retention by month"_
   3. _"Which products had the highest growth rate compared to last year?"_
3. Provide **feedback** using the **thumbs up/down** icons. To learn more about how Feedback works, read the related guide <u>Provide Feedback to the System.</u>

## Summary

In this tutorial, you learned how to connect your existing data sources to Wisdom AI, enabling the system to access and analyze your data. You selected the relevant data for your project and organized it into domains for better management. Finally, you began experimenting with your Wisdom AI chatbot to test its responses and evaluate its data analysis capabilities.

By completing these steps, you have set up a functional Wisdom AI chatbot connected to your data, ready to improve through your feedback and continued use.
