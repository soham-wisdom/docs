title: "Supported Data Sources"
---

This page covers the data sources that can be connected to WisdomAI, including databases, data warehouses, and CSV files. It outlines the connection requirements, necessary configurations, and troubleshooting tips for seamless integration.

WisdomAI works with the following data sources:

- PostgreSQL
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Databricks
- Snowflake
- Google BigQuery
- Amazon Redshift
- ClickHouse _(Beta)_
- Trino _(Beta)_
- CSV files

To learn how to connect to your Data Sources, read the [Basic Tutorial: Connect and Test](/setting-up-wisdom-ai/basic-tutorial-connect-and-test).

## Connection Requirements

This section outlines common prerequisites for connecting to data sources. Specific requirements are detailed under each data source.

- **Network Access:** Ensure WisdomAI has network access to your database or data warehouse host. This may involve configuring firewall rules or security groups.
- **Authentication Details:** You will need the correct credentials (username, password, keys, etc.) for your chosen data source.
- **SSL/TLS Configuration:** For secure connections, ensure your database/data warehouse is configured to accept SSL/TLS connections, and configure WisdomAI accordingly (e.g., `SSL Mode: require` for PostgreSQL).
- **Service Accounts (Google BigQuery):** For BigQuery, a Google Cloud service account with appropriate BigQuery permissions is required.

  <Info>
    **SSH Tunnel **

    For PostgreSQL and Amazon Redshift, you can optionally provide a bastion host to connect to the database using an SSH tunnel.
