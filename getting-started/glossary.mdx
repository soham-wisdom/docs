**Access to Reports**: The capability to view and interact with published reports.

**Administrator / Admin**: Highest-privilege user role with full access to connect data sources, configure domains, manage security, and govern the rollout of Wisdom AI. Also responsible for foundational setup and governance, including user, domain, data source, data model, and knowledge management, as well as accessing dashboards and reports, monitoring, and auditing.

**Agentic Analytics**: A multi-step analytic workflow executed by an internal planning agent that decomposes complex questions into sub-queries and composes the final answer automatically.

**Analysis Plan**: The intermediate set of steps (SQL, transformations, visualisations) generated by Wisdom AI when executing Agentic Analytics.

**Answer Accuracy Score**: A system metric that tracks the percentage of answers receiving positive feedback (üëç) versus total answers served, used to judge readiness for roll-out.

## C

**Capabilities**: Specific actions or functionalities that a user role is permitted to perform within WisdomAI.

**Chat Analytics**: Conversational, natural-language interaction mode where users ask questions and receive answers in real time.

**Column-Level Security**: A granular access control mechanism that restricts user access to specific columns within a data table.

**Compliance**: Practices that ensure Wisdom AI meets organisational or regulatory requirements (e.g., data retention, access logging).

**Connection**: An instance of a connector configured with credentials and network details, used to ingest or query data.

**Connector**: Reusable integration module that handles authentication and data extraction for a specific database, warehouse, or SaaS application.

**Continuous Learning**: Wisdom AI‚Äôs process of improving answer quality over time based on feedback, reviewed queries, and added context.

**Context Enhancement**: The act of supplying extra business logic, synonyms, or documentation so the NLQ engine produces domain-specific answers.

**CSV Upload**: A lightweight connection method in which a comma-separated file is uploaded directly and treated as a temporary data source.

## D

**Dashboard**: A collection of visualisations and answer cards arranged into a layout; called a _Story_ inside Wisdom AI.

**Data Administrator**: A role with privileges focused on domain and data-model maintenance but without full system-wide admin rights. They can connect domain-level data, model business context, manage content, apply data policies, and collaborate with Explorers.

**Data Dictionary**: Human-readable catalogue of domain tables, columns, metrics, and their business definitions.

**Data Model Augmentation**: Enhancing the semantic model with derived fields, entities, or metrics to create richer answers.

**Data Model Management**: The capability to define metrics, entities, and relationships relevant to data domains.

**Data Source**: Any origin from which Wisdom AI ingests data (database, warehouse, CSV, SaaS API, etc.).

**Data Source Management**: The ability to connect, set up, and configure external data sources within WisdomAI.

**Data Warehouse**: Centralised analytical database (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery) commonly used as a primary data source.

**Derived Column**: A calculated column added to a table or view within a domain, not present in the raw source.

**Derived Table**: A table produced from transformations or joins on raw tables, materialised or virtual, and added to the semantic model.

**Dimension**: Qualitative attribute (e.g., _country_, _product category_) used to group or filter metrics.

**Domain**: A configurable, dedicated space within the platform that represents a specific business area or dataset. It acts as a container for your data sources, business-specific knowledge (like context, metrics, and entities), and settings that fine-tune how the WisdomAI chatbot understands and interacts with your data.

Essentially, it is the fundamental unit where you connect your data, infuse it with business logic, and configure the AI to deliver accurate and relevant responses for data analysis.

**Domain Management**: The capability to configure and maintain organizational domains within WisdomAI.

**Domain-Level Permissions**: Fine-grained access rules that determine who can query or edit each domain.

**Domain-Specific Data Model Management**: The capability to define metrics, entities, and relationships relevant to a specific domain.

## E

**Embedded Analytics**: Mechanism for embedding Wisdom AI Stories or charts into external applications via iframe or public link.

**Entity**: A business object represented in the semantic model (e.g., _Customer_, _Order_); usually maps to a primary-key table.

**Explorer**: End-user role focused on asking questions, creating Stories, and sharing insights; cannot access admin configuration. They can ask questions, explore stories, use playbooks, share insights, save views, and utilize knowledge management, including access to dashboards and reports.

## F

**Feedback Loop**: Cycle in which user feedback (üëç/üëé, edits, reviewed queries) trains Wisdom AI to improve future answers.

**Fork (Chats)**: Create an independent copy of a chat or Story so it can be modified without affecting the original.

## G

**Go/No-Go Demo**: Validation checkpoint where Admins present curated dashboards to stakeholders to decide if Wisdom AI is ready for wider release.

**Governance**: Set of policies and controls that maintain data integrity, security, and compliance within Wisdom AI.

**Granular Access Controls**: A fine-grained approach to access control that allows for very specific permissions to be set, including row- and column-level security.

## I

**Invitation Link**: Time-bound URL that allows a new user to join a Wisdom AI tenant with a pre-assigned role.

## K

## M

**Metric**: Quantitative measure (e.g., _total revenue_, _active users_) defined in the semantic model and calculated by Wisdom AI.

**Monitoring Dashboard**: Admin-only Story that surfaces operational KPIs such as sync latency and answer accuracy.

## N

**Natural-Language Query (NLQ)**: An end-user question expressed in everyday language, parsed and converted to SQL by Wisdom AI.

## P

**Reviewed Query**: An NLQ that has been checked by an Admin, corrected if necessary, and saved as a trusted reference.

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: A security model where permissions are organized around roles, and users are assigned to roles, ensuring appropriate access based on responsibilities.

**Row-Level Access Control (RLS)**: Rules that restrict data visibility at the row level based on user attributes (e.g., region).

## S

**Scheduled Story**: Story or chart automatically sent at a defined cadence via email or Slack.

**Schemas**: The structure of tables and relationships within a database or data source.

**Semantic Model**: Layer that abstracts raw tables into business-friendly entities, metrics, relationships, and dimensions.
