title: "How WisdomAI Works"
---

WisdomAI is a powerful platform that helps businesses understand their data better and make smarter decisions. Think of it as a smart assistant that can take all your company's data and turn it into clear, easy-to-understand answers and visual stories. It's designed so that anyone in your business, whether they're a data expert or not, can ask questions in plain English and get immediate, helpful insights without needing to write complex code or build dashboards manually.

## What Does WisdomAI Do?

WisdomAI transforms your company's raw data into actionable insights through several key capabilities:

  <Card title="Understands Your Questions" icon="comments">
    You can ask questions in everyday language, like "What was our revenue last quarter?" or "Which products are selling best?" WisdomAI uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand what you're asking.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Connects to Your Data" icon="database">
    It seamlessly connects to various data sources your business uses, such as databases like PostgreSQL and SQL Server, or data warehouses like Snowflake and Google BigQuery.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Organizes Your Business Data" icon="sitemap">
    WisdomAI helps you organize your data into domains that represent different parts of your business, like Sales or Marketing. This makes your data more relevant and easier for everyone to use.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Turns Answers into Stories" icon="chart-simple">
    Instead of just giving you numbers, WisdomAI can create interactive **Stories** and dashboards with charts and text. These stories update automatically as your data changes, making it easy to share insights across your team.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Automates Workflows" icon="robot">
    You can set up Playbooks to automate common analytical tasks and standardize how your team analyzes specific business questions.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Learns and Improves" icon="lightbulb">
    WisdomAI continuously gets smarter based on user feedback. When you provide corrections or refine questions, the system learns to give even better answers in the future.
  </Card>
</Columns>

This means WisdomAI helps you quickly get the information you need from your data, making data-driven decisions simpler and faster for everyone.

## Who Uses WisdomAI?

WisdomAI is built for all kinds of businesses, from small startups to large corporations, across various industries. It's designed to be useful for different roles within your organization:

## WisdomAI vs Generic RAG Systems

Unlike generic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solutions that rely purely on embedding search over documents, WisdomAI builds a structured understanding of your data through semantic modeling, curated context, and validated logic.

| **Feature**                       | **WisdomAI** | **Generic RAG** |
| --------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Understands data relationships    | ✅            | ❌               |
| Requires semantic modeling        | ✅            | ❌               |
| Validated, testable logic         | ✅            | ❌               |
| Dynamic, auto-updating dashboards | ✅            | ❌               |
| Tailored for business data        | ✅            | ❌               |

<Tip>
  WisdomAI is purpose-built for enterprise analytics, not just document Q&A.

## Data Flow & Architecture Overview

WisdomAI transforms your business data into actionable insights using a multi-layered pipeline. The following components work together to deliver accurate, contextualized answers and auto-updating data stories.

  subgraph Data_Pipeline [ ]
    direction TB
    A[Connected Data Sources] --> B[Semantic Modeling Layer]
    B --> C[Natural Language Query Engine]
    C --> D[Answer Generation & Story Builder]
    D --> E[Delivery & Reporting Layer]
    E --> F[User Feedback & Corrections]
    F --> G[Context Updates & Review]
    G --> B
  end

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connected Data Sources" stepNumber={1} titleSize="h3">
    WisdomAI integrates with your data platforms (like Snowflake, BigQuery, or Redshift), acting as the entry point of all information flowing through the system.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Semantic Modeling" stepNumber={2} titleSize="h3">
    Admins and data owners enrich the data by documenting tables, columns, and domains. They also define relationships (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) to create a business-friendly context for natural language understanding.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Natural Language Query (NLQ) Engine" stepNumber={3} titleSize="h3">
    Users ask questions in plain language. The NLQ engine parses these questions and translates them into SQL queries using the underlying semantic model.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Answer Generation and Story Builder" stepNumber={4} titleSize="h3">
    Responses are generated and formatted into interactive "Stories", data-driven narratives that combine visualizations, text, and insights. These can be scheduled and shared.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delivery and Reporting Layer" stepNumber={5} titleSize="h3">
    Stories and answers can be delivered via email or embedded within dashboards, helping teams stay informed with minimal effort.
  </Step>
  <Step title="User Feedback and Corrections" stepNumber={6} titleSize="h3">
    Users can give feedback on story accuracy, suggest corrections, or add clarifying context to improve future results.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Context Updates and Review Loop" stepNumber={7} titleSize="h3">
    Admins and Editors review user feedback and update the semantic layer accordingly, closing the loop and continuously improving answer quality and domain understanding.
  </Step>
