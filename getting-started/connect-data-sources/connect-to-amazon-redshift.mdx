title: "Connect to Amazon Redshift"
---

WisdomAI allows you to connect to Amazon Redshift by choosing one of three methods:

1. [Direct Connection](#option-1%3A-direct-connection)
2. [Connect via an SSH Tunnel](#option-2%3A-connect-via-an-ssh-tunnel)
3. [Connect via VPC Peering](#option-3%3A-connect-via-vpc-peering)\\

This flexibility ensures you can establish a secure connection that matches your specific network architecture.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Your Amazon Redshift cluster endpoint, port, database name, and user credentials.
- Network access that allows WisdomAI to connect to your Redshift cluster. This may require configuring your firewall or AWS security groups.
- If using an SSH tunnel, you need the credentials for your bastion host.
- If using VPC peering, you need permissions to manage VPC settings in your AWS account.

## Option 1: Direct Connection

Use this method if your Redshift cluster is publicly accessible or if you have whitelisted WisdomAI's IP addresses in your security group.

1. In WisdomAl, navigate to the **Connections** section and click **Add Connection**.
2. Select **Redshift** as the data source type.
3. Fill in the connection details in the **Redshift connection details** section:

| Requirement      | Description                                      |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| Host             | Redshift cluster endpoint                        |
| Port             | Typically `5439`                                 |
| Username         | Database user with read access                   |
| Password         | User password                                    |
| Database Filters | Optionally restrict which databases are crawled. |

4. Click **Save and Sync metadata.** WisdomAl will use the provided credentials to connect to your Redshift account and scan the metadata of the specified databases and tables.

## Option 2: Connect via an SSH Tunnel

Use this method to securely connect to a Redshift cluster that is not publicly accessible by routing traffic through a bastion host.

1. On the **Add Connection** page, fill in the direct connection details and expand the **SSH Tunnel Configuration** section.
2. Complete the **SSH Tunnel configuration fields**.

| Requirement              | Description                                                   |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SSH Host                 | Hostname or IP address of the bastion host                    |
| SSH Port                 | Port number on the SSH host (e.g., `22`)                      |
| SSH Username             | The username required to log in to the bastion host           |
| Authentication Method    | Authenticate using either a **Private Key** or a **Password** |
| SSH Private Key/Password | The Private Key or Password for the SSH authentication        |

3. Click **Save and Sync metadata.**

## Option 3: Connect via VPC Peering

This method establishes a private, secure connection between WisdomAI's AWS environment and your Amazon VPC. This process is managed with the help of the WisdomAI support team.

<Warning>
  VPC Peering cannot be configured directly in the UI. You must contact the WisdomAI support team to initiate this process.
</Warning>

1. Collect the following details from your AWS account:
   - AWS Account ID and Region of the VPC
   - VPC ID
   - VPC CIDR block(s) (both primary and any secondary)
2. Email the information gathered in the previous step to the WisdomAI support team at `support@askwisdom.ai` to request a VPC peering connection.
3. The WisdomAI team will initiate a VPC peering request. You will receive an email with the request details and instructions to accept it within your AWS Management Console.
4. After accepting the request, you must update your VPC's route tables to direct traffic destined for the WisdomAI VPC through the peering connection. You also need to configure your security group rules to allow inbound traffic from WisdomAI's VPC CIDR. The support team will provide all necessary information for these steps.
