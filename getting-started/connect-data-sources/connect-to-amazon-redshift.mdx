This tutorial guides you through the process of connecting WisdomAI to your Amazon Redshift data warehouse. By the end, you will be able to establish a secure connection using one of three methods: a direct connection, an SSH tunnel, or VPC peering.

## Before you begin

Ensure you have the following before starting:

- Your Amazon Redshift cluster endpoint, port, database name, and user credentials.
- Network access that allows WisdomAI to connect to your Redshift cluster. This may require configuring your firewall or AWS security groups.
- If using an SSH tunnel, you need the credentials for your bastion host.
- If using VPC peering, you need permissions to manage VPC settings in your AWS account.

## Connection Methods

There are three ways to connect your Amazon Redshift data warehouse to WisdomAI:

1. [Direct Connection](#option-1-direct-connection)
2. [Connect via an SSH Tunnel](#option-2-connect-via-an-ssh-tunnel)
3. [Connect via VPC Peering](#option-3-connect-via-vpc-peering)

### Option 1: Direct Connection

Use this method if your Redshift cluster is publicly accessible or if you have whitelisted WisdomAI's IP addresses in your security group.

1. Navigate to the **Data Sources** page in WisdomAI.
2. Click **Add Data Source** and select **Amazon Redshift**.
3. Fill in the required connection details.

| Requirement | Description                    |
| :---------- | :----------------------------- |
| Host        | Redshift cluster endpoint      |
| Port        | Typically `5439`               |
| Database    | Database name                  |
| Username    | Database user with read access |
| Password    | User password                  |
| Schema      | Schema name (optional)         |

4. Click **Test Connection** to verify that WisdomAI can reach your data warehouse.
5. If the test is successful, click **Save**.

### Option 2: Connect via an SSH Tunnel

Use this method to securely connect to a Redshift cluster that is not publicly accessible by routing traffic through a bastion host.

1. Navigate to the **Data Sources** page in WisdomAI.
2. Click **Add Data Source** and select **Amazon Redshift**.
3. Fill in the standard database details and the SSH Tunnel configuration fields.

| Requirement              | Description                                                   |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Host                     | Redshift cluster endpoint                                     |
| Port                     | Typically `5439`                                              |
| Database                 | Database name                                                 |
| Username                 | Database user with read access                                |
| Password                 | User password                                                 |
| Schema                   | Schema name (optional)                                        |
| SSH Host                 | Hostname or IP address of the bastion host                    |
| SSH Port                 | Port number on the SSH host (e.g., `22`)                      |
| SSH Username             | The username required to log in to the bastion host           |
| Authentication Method    | Authenticate using either a **Private Key** or a **Password** |
| SSH Private Key/Password | The Private Key or Password for the SSH authentication        |

4. Click **Test Connection** to validate the configuration.
5. If the test is successful, click **Save**.

### Option 3: Connect via VPC Peering

This method establishes a private, secure connection between WisdomAI's AWS environment and your Amazon VPC. This process is managed with the help of the WisdomAI support team.

<Warning>
  VPC Peering cannot be configured directly in the UI. You must contact the WisdomAI support team to initiate this process.
</Warning>

1. Collect the following details from your AWS account:
   - AWS Account ID and Region of the VPC
   - VPC ID
   - VPC CIDR block(s) (both primary and any secondary)
2. Email the information gathered in the previous step to the WisdomAI support team at `support@askwisdom.ai` to request a VPC peering connection.
3. The WisdomAI team will initiate a VPC peering request. You will receive an email with the request details and instructions to accept it within your AWS Management Console.
4. After accepting the request, you must update your VPC's route tables to direct traffic destined for the WisdomAI VPC through the peering connection. You also need to configure your security group rules to allow inbound traffic from WisdomAI's VPC CIDR. The support team will provide all necessary information for these steps.
