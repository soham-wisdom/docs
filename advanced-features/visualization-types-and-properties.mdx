### Available Chart Types

| Chart Type                      | Feature                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Table**                       | Displays raw data in a structured format, ideal for precise values and detailed comparisons.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Pie Chart**                   | Best for showing proportions within a whole, where each slice represents a percentage of the total. (Consider using for 5-7 slices maximum.)                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Funnel Chart**                | Illustrates how values progress through different stages of a sequential process, often used to visualize conversion or attrition rates.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Bar Chart**                   | Useful for comparing quantities across discrete categories, with the length of the bars representing the values.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Bar Chart (stacked)**         | Displays multiple data series in a single bar, where segments within the bar show the contribution of each part to the whole. Useful for comparing sub-categories and their cumulative totals.                                                                                                |
| **Bar Chart (100% stacked)**    | Similar to a stacked bar chart, but each bar represents 100% of a category, with segments showing the percentage contribution of subcategories. Ideal for showing part-to-whole relationships and how proportions change over time. (Be cautious as overall totals are not explicitly shown.) |
| **Column Chart**                | Visually represents numerical values using vertical columns. Ideal for comparing discrete categories, often with the height of the column corresponding to the value.                                                                                                                         |
| **Column Chart (stacked)**      | Presents multiple data series as vertical bars, with segments stacked to show their cumulative sum. Aids in comparisons between categories over time or across different groups.                                                                                                              |
| **Column Chart (100% stacked)** | Compares multiple measures by stacking bars vertically, where each segment represents the percentage of the overall category total. Useful for showing the distribution of components within a whole at a specific point in time or across time.                                              |
| **Area Chart (stacked)**        | Shows data as an area under a line that connects data points, with multiple series stacked on top of each other. Useful for displaying the contribution of different components to a whole while showing overall patterns and cumulative trends over time.                                    |
| **Area Chart**                  | Visualizes quantitative data and shows how values changes over a period of time, with the area between the line and the baseline filled with color. Ideal for emphasizing trends and the magnitude of change.                                                                                 |
| **Line Chart**                  | Ideal for displaying trends over time or across continuous measurements, showing how data changes and identifying patterns. (Excellent for time-series data.)                                                                                                                                 |
| **Map**                         | Transforms geographic data into visual insights by displaying information across different regions, countries, or territories. Useful for visualizing spatial patterns and distributions.                                                                                                     |

These visualization options enable users to tailor the presentation of data to their specific analytical needs.

## Switchable Encodings

Within the Editor tab, users can customize data encodings to refine their visualizations:

- **Axis Assignment** – Drag and drop data columns to assign them to the X and Y axes\
  _(e.g., "Region" on X-axis, "Total Revenue SUM" on Y-axis)_.
- **Data Filtering** – Apply filters to focus on specific data subsets\
  _(e.g., "Stage Label: Closed Won")_.
- **Aggregation Functions** – Use SUM, AVG, etc., to aggregate numerical data as needed.

These features allow for dynamic adjustment of visualizations to highlight the most relevant insights.

## Interaction Options

WisdomAI provides interactive elements to enhance user engagement and data exploration:

- **Editable SQL** – Modify the generated SQL queries in the **SQL** tab to correct or fine-tune results.
- **Feedback Mechanism** – Give a thumbs up or down to improve future AI responses.
- **Review & Validation** – Mark queries as reviewed to confirm accuracy in team workflows.

These interaction options support iterative refinement and validation of data analyses.

## Accessibility Notes

WisdomAI emphasizes accessibility to ensure a wide range of users can effectively engage with Stories:

- **Natural Language Interface** – Ask questions using plain English to generate data queries.
- **Visual Configuration Tools** – Use drag-and-drop components in the Editor to configure visuals without writing code.
- **Collaborative Integrations** – Access insights directly from platforms like Slack or Teams, supporting seamless workflows.

These features aim to make data exploration more inclusive and user-friendly for technical and non-technical users alike.
