title: Create and Manage an Agent
---

An Agent is an automated entity you can configure to run continuously. You can set an Agent to activate on a specific schedule. When activated, it evaluates a condition you define (a "trigger"). If the trigger condition is met, the Agent performs a detailed analysis and sends the results to your specified notification channels.

<Note>
The Agents feature is currently in beta.

## Create a New Agent

To create a new agent, follow these steps:

1.  From the sidebar on the left, select the **Agents** tab.
2.  If no agents have been configured, you will see a welcome screen. Click **Get started**.
3.  In the configuration form, define the Agent's basic settings:
    * **Select a domain**: Choose the data domain the Agent will run in.
    * **Agent name**: Provide a descriptive name for your Agent to easily identify it later.
4.  Configure the **Trigger**. The trigger is a condition written in natural language that determines if the analysis should run.
    * In the text box, describe the condition. You can write complex criteria. For example: `If total sales in the last year fall below $100,000`.
    * Click **Test** to check if your trigger condition is currently met. This helps you verify that the criteria works as expected.

<Tip>
Start with simple, single-condition triggers to ensure they work as expected before creating more complex ones.
</Tip>

5.  Define the **Analysis**. The analysis is the task the Agent will perform if the trigger condition is met.
    * In the work description text box, describe the analysis you want in natural language. For example: `Send me a list of all lost deals along with their region, their owner, and their total value`.
    * Click **Test** to run the analysis and see a sample of the output. This allows you to preview the results that will be sent in the notification.
6.  Set the **Schedule** for the Agent to run.
    * Choose a start date and time.
    * Define the frequency, such as every day.
7.  Configure **Notifications** to define how you will receive the analysis results.
    * **Email**: Select this option and enter one or more email addresses. The notification will contain charts and tables from the analysis.
    * **Slack**: Select this option and specify the Slack channel names.

<Note>
To use the Slack notification option, you must first have a Slack workspace connected.
</Note>

8.  Click **Create Agent** to save and activate it.

## Manage Existing Agents

After an Agent is created, it appears in a list on the main **Agents** page. From this page, you can manage all the Agents you have access to.

### Test an Agent

You can test the Agent's entire workflow from start to finish.

1.  On the **Agents** page, find the Agent you wish to test.
2.  Click **Test**.
3.  This action manually activates the Agent, which will then:
    * Evaluate the trigger criteria.
    * If the criteria are met, it will run the full analysis and send a notification to the configured channels.

<Warning>
A notification is only sent if the trigger criteria are satisfied.
</Warning>

### View Run History

You can view a log of every time an Agent has run.

1.  From the **Agents** list, select the Agent you want to review.
2.  Click **View Runs** to see a timeline of its past executions.
3.  The run history shows:
    * When the Agent was activated.
    * Whether the trigger criteria were met.
    * The status of the analysis (e.g., completed successfully or failed).
    * A link to the conversation containing the generated analysis, allowing you to ask follow-up questions.

### Edit and Share an Agent

* **Edit**: To modify an Agent, click the **Edit** button to return to its configuration form.
* **Share**: You can share an Agent with other users to allow for collaboration. Once shared, other users can also edit the Agent.

### Use Deep Analysis with an Agent

You can have an Agent run its analysis using the Deep Analysis feature.

1.  When creating or editing an Agent, enable the **Deep Analysis** toggle.
2.  When the Agent runs, it will automatically generate and execute a multi-step analysis plan based on your work description. You will not be prompted to approve the plan; it will run automatically.

## Use Case Examples

Here are a couple of examples of how you can use an Agent.

### Monitoring for Performance Dips

This is a common use case for monitoring business health and detecting anomalies. You can set up an Agent to watch a key metric and alert you only when it drops into an undesirable range.

* **Scenario**: A sales manager wants to be automatically notified if sales performance drops below a specific daily threshold.
* **Trigger Example**: `If total sales in the last day fall below $100,000`.
* **Analysis Example**: `Send me a list of all lost deals from the last day, including their region, owner, and total value`.
* **Outcome**: The manager receives an alert only when a problem is detected, allowing them to investigate the cause of the low sales immediately without needing to manually run reports each day.

### Tracking Significant Changes

You can also use an Agent to monitor for significant changes in a metric, whether positive or negative. The trigger can be configured to activate if a metric moves outside of its typical range.

* **Scenario**: A finance team wants to track if monthly revenue deviates significantly from the previous month's performance.
* **Trigger Example**: `If revenue this month is outside a 4% range of last month's revenue`.
* **Analysis Example**: `Provide a breakdown of revenue by product category and compare it to last month`.
* **Outcome**: The team is notified of any unusual volatility. This allows them to analyze a sudden revenue spike to understand what went right or investigate a drop to see what went wrong.
