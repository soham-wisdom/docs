title: "Create and Manage an Agent"
---

Manually checking a dashboard every morning to track key business metrics is time-consuming. Instead, you can create an automated monitoring workflow using the Agents feature in WisdomAI. An Agent is an automated process that you configure to keep track of your most important metrics without needing to run manual checks.

An Agent works by following these steps:

1. Wakes up on a schedule you define (e.g., every day at 9:00 AM).
2. If set, evaluates a condition, called a Trigger (e.g., checks if yesterday's sales were below \$50,000). If no trigger is set, the agent proceeds to the next step every time it runs.
3. Acts by running an analysis and sending a notification to your specified notification channels.

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to create an agent that monitors a key business metric, runs a follow-up analysis when a specific condition is met, and sends a notification to your team.

<Note>
  1. This guide uses sales monitoring scenarios, but you can apply these steps to any metric you need to watch.
  2. The Agents feature is currently in beta.
</Note>

## Before you Begin

Make sure you have the following:

- **Access to WisdomAI**: You need an active account to access the Agents feature.
- **A Goal in Mind**: Know which business metric you want to monitor (e.g., sales, user sign-ups, error rates).
- **(Optional) Slack Integration**: If you want to send alerts to a Slack channel, an administrator must first connect your Slack workspace to WisdomAI.

  <Note>
    Read the [Slack](https://docs.askwisdom.ai/integrations/connect-to-slack) guide to learn how to do it.

## Create an Agent

To create a new agent, follow these steps:

1. From the sidebar on the left, select the **Agents** tab.
2. If no agents have been configured, you will see a welcome screen. Click **Get started**.

![Screenshot showing the Get Started button](/images/2025-08-26_12-26-03.png)

3. **Select a Domain**: Choose the data domain the Agent will run in.
4. **Agent Name**: Provide a descriptive name for your Agent to easily identify it later.
5. Configure the **Activation** **Trigger**. The optional trigger allows you to choose between two modes of operation: scheduled reporting or conditional monitoring.
   1. **Trigger Disabled (Scheduled Reporting)**: Leave the trigger disabled to use the Agent for scheduled reporting. In this mode, the analysis will always run and send out a notification according to the schedule you set.
   2. **Trigger Enabled (Conditional Monitoring)**: Enable the trigger to use the Agent as a monitor for specific conditions. In this mode, an analysis and notification are sent only if the trigger's conditions are satisfied.
      - In the text box, describe the condition. You can write complex criteria. For example: `If total sales in the last year fall below $100,000`.
      - Click **Test** to check if your trigger condition is currently met. This helps you verify that the criteria works as expected. Learn more in the [Test an Agent During Configuration](#test-an-agent-during-configuration) section of this tutorial.

        <Tip>
          Start with simple, single-condition triggers to ensure they work as expected before creating more complex ones.
        </Tip>

6. Define the **Work Description**. This is the task the Agent will perform if the trigger condition is met.
   - In the work description text box, describe the analysis and action you want in natural language. For example: `Send me a list of all lost deals along with their region, their owner, and their total value`.
   - Click **Test** to run the analysis and see a sample of the output. This allows you to preview the results that will be sent in the notification. Learn more in the [Test an Agent During Configuration](#test-an-agent-during-configuration) section of this tutorial.
7. Set the **Schedule** for the Agent to run.
   - Choose a start date and time.
   - Define the frequency, such as every day or week.
8. Configure **Notifications** to define how you will receive the analysis results.
   - **Email**: Select this option and enter one or more email addresses. The notification will contain charts and tables from the analysis.
   - **Slack**: Select this option and specify the Slack channel names.

<Note>
  To use the Slack notification option, you must first have a Slack workspace connected. Read the [Connect to Slack](https://docs.askwisdom.ai/integrations/connect-to-slack) guide to learn how to do it.
</Note>

9. Click **Create Agent** to save and activate it.

## Test an Agent During Configuration

While creating or editing an Agent, you can test its two main components, the **Activation Trigger** and the **Work Description**, independently before saving. This helps you refine each part and ensure the Agent will behave as expected.

- **Test the Activation Trigger**: Below the trigger text box (this is only visible when the trigger is enabled), click **Test** to check if your condition is currently met based on the data. This is useful for verifying that your natural language criteria are written correctly and will activate when you expect them to. The test will show you if the trigger would fire and why.
- **Test the Work Description**: Below the work description text box, click **Test** to run the analysis and preview the output. This allows you to see a sample of the report that the Agent will generate, so you can adjust the description to get the exact information you need in your notifications.

## Manage Existing Agents

After an Agent is created, it appears in a list on the main **Agents** page. From this page, you can manage all the Agents you have access to.

To manage an individual agent, locate it in the list and click the **three-dot menu (...)** under the **Actions** column. A dropdown menu will appear with the following options:

- **Share**: Allows you to share the Agent with other users for collaboration.
- **Test**: Manually runs the Agent's entire workflow. The Agent will evaluate its trigger (if enabled) and, if the conditions are met (or if the trigger is disabled), run the full analysis and send a notification.

  <Warning>
    A notification is only sent if the trigger criteria are satisfied.
  </Warning>
- **Edit**: Opens the configuration form, allowing you to modify the Agent's name, trigger, work description, or schedule.
- **Delete**: Permanently removes the Agent. This action cannot be undone.

### View Previous Runs

You can view a detailed history of every time an agent has run. This log is useful for auditing and debugging an agent's behavior over time.

1. To see the log, find your agent on the **Agents** page and click the **Previous Runs** link in its corresponding row.
2. This will take you to the **Previous Runs** page, which displays a timeline of all past executions. Each entry in the log shows the status of the agent's key stages:

| **Stage**        | **Description**                                                           |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **WAKE UP**      | Confirms the agent started at its scheduled time.                         |
| **EVALUATION**   | Shows whether the trigger criteria were met.                              |
| **ANALYSIS**     | Confirms if the analysis was completed successfully.                      |
| **NOTIFICATION** | Shows if the notification was sent successfully or if there was an error. |

3. If an analysis was successfully generated, you can click the **View Conversation** button within the ANALYSIS step. This will take you to the specific conversation where you can inspect the detailed results and the exact query that was run for that execution.

### Use Deep Analysis with an Agent

You can have an Agent run its analysis using the Deep Analysis feature. When you enable Deep Analysis for an Agent, it performs a more thorough analysis by exploring multiple aspects of the data and providing comprehensive insights. This process may take longer but yields more detailed results.

1. When creating or editing an Agent, enable the **Deep Analysis** toggle.
2. When the Agent runs, it will automatically generate and execute a multi-step analysis plan based on your work description. You will not be prompted to approve the plan; it will run automatically.

<Note>
  To learn more about this functionality, read the [Deep Analysis Functionality](https://docs.askwisdom.ai/advanced-features/deep-analysis) article.

## Use Case Examples

Here are a couple of examples of how you can use an Agent.

### Monitoring for Performance Dips

This is a common use case for monitoring business health and detecting anomalies. You can set up an Agent to watch a key metric and alert you only when it drops into an undesirable range.

- **Scenario**: A sales manager wants to be automatically notified if sales performance drops below a specific daily threshold.
- **Trigger Example**: `If total sales in the last day fall below $100,000`.
- **Analysis Example**: `Send me a list of all lost deals from the last day, including their region, owner, and total value`.
- **Outcome**: The manager receives an alert only when a problem is detected, allowing them to investigate the cause of the low sales immediately without needing to manually run reports each day.

### Tracking Significant Changes

You can also use an Agent to monitor for significant changes in a metric, whether positive or negative. The trigger can be configured to activate if a metric moves outside of its typical range.

- **Scenario**: A finance team wants to track if monthly revenue deviates significantly from the previous month's performance.
- **Trigger Example**: `If revenue this month is outside a 4% range of last month's revenue`.
- **Analysis Example**: `Provide a breakdown of revenue by product category and compare it to last month`.
- **Outcome**: The team is notified of any unusual volatility. This allows them to analyze a sudden revenue spike to understand what went right or investigate a drop to see what went wrong.
