title: "Create and Manage an Agent"

Manually checking a dashboard every morning to track key business metrics is time-consuming. Instead, you can create an automated monitoring workflow using the Agents feature in WisdomAI. An Agent is an automated process that you configure to keep track of your most important metrics without needing to run manual checks.

An Agent works by following three steps:

1. Wakes up on a schedule you define (e.g., every day at 9:00 AM).
2. Evaluates a condition, called a Trigger (e.g., checks if yesterday's sales were below \$50,000).
3. Acts only if the condition is true by running an analysis and sending a notification to your specified notification channels.

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to create an agent that monitors a key business metric, runs a follow-up analysis when a specific condition is met, and sends a notification to your team.

<Note>
  1. This guide uses sales monitoring scenarios, but you can apply these steps to any metric you need to watch.
  2. The Agents feature is currently in beta.
</Note>

## Before you Begin

Make sure you have the following:

- **Access to WisdomAI**: You need an active account to access the Agents feature.
- **A Goal in Mind**: Know which business metric you want to monitor (e.g., sales, user sign-ups, error rates).
- **(Optional) Slack Integration**: If you want to send alerts to a Slack channel, an administrator must first connect your Slack workspace to WisdomAI.

  <Note>
    Read the Connect to Slack guide to learn how to do it.

## Create an Agent

To create a new agent, follow these steps:

1. From the sidebar on the left, select the **Agents** tab.
2. If no agents have been configured, you will see a welcome screen. Click **Get started**.

3. In the configuration form, define the Agent's basic settings:
   - **Select a Domain**: Choose the data domain the Agent will run in.
   - **Agent Name**: Provide a descriptive name for your Agent to easily identify it later.
4. Configure the **Activation** **Trigger**. The trigger is a condition written in natural language that determines if the analysis should run.
   - In the text box, describe the condition. You can write complex criteria. For example: `If total sales in the last year fall below $100,000`.
   - Click **Test** to check if your trigger condition is currently met. This helps you verify that the criteria works as expected. Learn more in the [Test an Agent During Configuration](#test-an-agent-during-configuration) section of this tutorial.

<Tip>
  Start with simple, single-condition triggers to ensure they work as expected before creating more complex ones.
</Tip>

5. Define the **Work Description**. This is the task the Agent will perform if the trigger condition is met.
   - In the work description text box, describe the analysis and action you want in natural language. For example: `Send me a list of all lost deals along with their region, their owner, and their total value`.
   - Click **Test** to run the analysis and see a sample of the output. This allows you to preview the results that will be sent in the notification. Learn more in the [Test an Agent During Configuration](#test-an-agent-during-configuration) section of this tutorial.
6. Set the **Schedule** for the Agent to run.
   - Choose a start date and time.
   - Define the frequency, such as every day or week.
7. Configure **Notifications** to define how you will receive the analysis results.
   - **Email**: Select this option and enter one or more email addresses. The notification will contain charts and tables from the analysis.
   - **Slack**: Select this option and specify the Slack channel names.

<Note>
  To use the Slack notification option, you must first have a Slack workspace connected. Read the Connect to Slack guide to learn how to do it.
</Note>

8. Click **Create Agent** to save and activate it.

## Test an Agent During Configuration

While creating or editing an Agent, you can test its two main components, the **Activation Trigger** and the **Work Description**, independently before saving. This helps you refine each part and ensure the Agent will behave as expected.

- **Test the Trigger**: Below the trigger text box, click **Test** to check if your condition is currently met based on the data. This is useful for verifying that your natural language criteria are written correctly and will activate when you expect them to. The test will show you if the trigger would fire and why.
- **Test the Work Description**: Below the work description text box, click **Test** to run the analysis and preview the output. This allows you to see a sample of the report that the Agent will generate, so you can adjust the description to get the exact information you need in your notifications.

## Manage Existing Agents

After an Agent is created, it appears in a list on the main **Agents** page. From this page, you can manage all the Agents you have access to.

### Test an Agent

You can test the Agent's entire workflow from start to finish.

1. On the **Agents** page, find the Agent you wish to test.
2. Click **Test**.
3. This action manually activates the Agent, which will then:
   - Evaluate the trigger criteria.
   - If the criteria are met, it will run the full analysis and send a notification to the configured channels.

<Warning>
  A notification is only sent if the trigger criteria are satisfied.
</Warning>

### Edit and Share an Agent

- **Edit**: To modify an Agent, click the **Edit** button to return to its configuration form.
- **Share**: You can share an Agent with other users to allow for collaboration. Once shared, other users can also edit the Agent.

### Use Deep Analysis with an Agent

You can have an Agent run its analysis using the Deep Analysis feature.

1. When creating or editing an Agent, enable the **Deep Analysis** toggle.
2. When the Agent runs, it will automatically generate and execute a multi-step analysis plan based on your work description. You will not be prompted to approve the plan; it will run automatically.

<Note>
  To learn more about this functionality, read the Deep Analysis article.

## Use Case Examples

Here are a couple of examples of how you can use an Agent.

### Monitoring for Performance Dips

This is a common use case for monitoring business health and detecting anomalies. You can set up an Agent to watch a key metric and alert you only when it drops into an undesirable range.

- **Scenario**: A sales manager wants to be automatically notified if sales performance drops below a specific daily threshold.
- **Trigger Example**: `If total sales in the last day fall below $100,000`.
- **Analysis Example**: `Send me a list of all lost deals from the last day, including their region, owner, and total value`.
- **Outcome**: The manager receives an alert only when a problem is detected, allowing them to investigate the cause of the low sales immediately without needing to manually run reports each day.

### Tracking Significant Changes

You can also use an Agent to monitor for significant changes in a metric, whether positive or negative. The trigger can be configured to activate if a metric moves outside of its typical range.

- **Scenario**: A finance team wants to track if monthly revenue deviates significantly from the previous month's performance.
- **Trigger Example**: `If revenue this month is outside a 4% range of last month's revenue`.
- **Analysis Example**: `Provide a breakdown of revenue by product category and compare it to last month`.
- **Outcome**: The team is notified of any unusual volatility. This allows them to analyze a sudden revenue spike to understand what went right or investigate a drop to see what went wrong.
