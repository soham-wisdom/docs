title: "Manage Organizations"
---

This guide explains how to use the Organizations manager to create and maintain isolated environments within your tenant. Organizations ensure full data separation, meaning that connections, domains, users, dashboards, and agents are kept entirely independent across different environments.

## Before you start

To perform these tasks, you must have overall site administrator permissions. Regular users or organization-level admins cannot access the global Organizations manager.

Read the [Access Management](/manage-account/access-management) guide to learn more about roles and permissions.

## Create a new Organization

Currently, our team handles provisioning new organizations to ensure your environment is configured correctly.

To create a new organization, please [contact the WisdomAI support team](/manage-account/contact-support). Provide the desired Organization Name and your preferred URI (e.g., `finance`), and our team will set up the blank environment and unique access URL (e.g., `https://try.askwisdom.ai/orgs/finance`) for you.

## Manage existing Organizations

Once created, you can manage organizations directly from the dashboard using quick-access icons.

### Modify settings and access

- **Edit Details**: Click the **three-dot menu (...)** on an organization tile and select **Edit** to update the name, URI, or administrative owners.

- **Access Domains**: Click the **monitor icon** to configure AI domains specific to that organization.
- **Manage Connections**: Click the **sync/connections icon** to set up or modify data source integrations for that environment.

### User administration

Click the **person icon** on an organization tile to open the user management view:

- **Invite Users**: Click **Invite Users** to grant access to the specific organization.
- **Export List**: Click **Export to CSV** to download a record of all users assigned to the organization.

### Archive an organization

If an environment is no longer needed, you can deactivate it to prevent further access.

1. Click the **three-dot menu (...)** on the organization tile.
2. Select **Archive organization**.
3. Confirm the action in the dialog box.

<Note>
  Archiving deactivates the organization immediately, meaning users will no longer be able to log in. However, your data is **not deleted**; it remains securely stored in case you need to reactivate the environment in the future.
