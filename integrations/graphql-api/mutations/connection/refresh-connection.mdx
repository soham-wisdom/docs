title: "Refresh Connection"
---

The `connectionRefresh` mutation triggers an asynchronous job that refreshes the metadata for a data warehouse connection. Specifically, it refreshes the list of databases, tables, and columns for the given connection.

This operation starts a background job and returns immediately without waiting for completion. The refresh process will discover new tables, updated schemas, and column changes in your data warehouse.

## Signature

```graphql
connectionRefresh(id: ID!): Boolean!
```

<Note>
  This mutation can only be executed by an administrator or a data administrator of the specific connection ID.
</Note>

<Warning>
  The refresh cannot be triggered when a connection is already in `QUEUED` or `RUNNING` status. Wait for the current sync to complete before starting a new one.
</Warning>

## Arguments

<ParamField path="id" type="ID!" required>
  The unique identifier of the connection to refresh
</ParamField>

## Response

The response returns a `Boolean` indicating whether the refresh job was successfully triggered:

- `true` - Refresh job was successfully started

<Info>
  On failure, the mutation throws a GraphQL error rather than returning `false`.
</Info>

## Usage Example

To refresh a connection's metadata, provide the connection ID to the mutation. Here's an example of how this mutation could be used:

```graphql
mutation RefreshConnection($id: ID!) {
  connectionRefresh(id: $id)
}
```
