Integrate WisdomAI with your Slack workspace to query your business data directly from your channels and direct messages. This allows you to get insights without switching contexts.

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have the following:

- An active WisdomAI account.
- Administrative permissions to install apps in your Slack workspace.

## Connect to Your Slack Workspace

Follow these steps to connect your WisdomAI account to Slack:

1. Navigate to the Slack integration page in your WisdomAI account at `https://<your-account>.askwisdom.ai/slack`. Remember to replace `<your-account>` with your specific account name.
2. Initiate the Connection by clicking the **Connect to Slack** button.
3. Authorize the Application on the Slack page you are redirected to. After reviewing the permissions WisdomAI is requesting, click **Allow** to grant access and install the app in your workspace.

5. Look for `@WisdomAI` app on your slack workspace and start using it. When you open a direct message with the app, you will see a welcome message and some suggested questions. You can now ask questions in natural language to get insights from your data directly within Slack.

## Permissions

When you connect WisdomAI to Slack, you will be asked to grant a set of permissions. These allow the WisdomAI app to receive your questions and post answers back into your workspace.

Here is a detailed breakdown of what each permission allows WisdomAI to do:

| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app_mentions:read` | Allows the app to see messages that directly mention `@WisdomAI` in conversations where the app is in.             |
| `assistant:write`   | Allows WisdomAI to act as an AI Assistant, enabling it to provide intelligent responses and analysis within Slack. |

| `files:write`       | Allows WisdomAI to upload, edit, and delete files.                                                                 |
| `im:history`        | View messages and content in direct messages with the WisdomAI app.                                                |

| `users:read.email`  | View email addresses of people in the workspace.                                                                   |

## Query Your Data in Slack

After connecting the app, you can interact with WisdomAI directly from your Slack workspace.

1. **Ask a Question**: You can start a direct message with the WisdomAI app or mention it in a channel to ask a question in natural language. The app will confirm that it is processing your request.
2. **Receive an Answer**: WisdomAI delivers an interactive response directly in Slack. A typical answer includes:
   - A chart visualizing the data, such as a bar chart of AWS usage by service.
   - A set of suggested follow-up questions to guide your analysis.
   - Buttons to **Show data**, **Show SQL**, change the chart type, or **Export CSV**.

     />
3. **Interact with Results**: You can modify the visualization and explore the data without leaving Slack. For example, you can change the chart to an Area chart or expand the data table to see the specific values for each service.  See the example below:
