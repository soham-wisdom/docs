Integrate WisdomAI with your Slack workspace to query your business data directly from your channels and direct messages. This allows you to get insights without switching contexts.

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have the following:

- An active WisdomAI account.

## Connect to Your Slack Workspace

Follow these steps to connect your WisdomAI account to Slack:

1. Navigate to the Slack integration page in your WisdomAI account at `https://<your-account>.askwisdom.ai/slack`. Remember to replace `<your-account>` with your specific account name.
2. Initiate the Connection by clicking the **Connect to Slack** button.
3. Authorize the Application on the Slack page you are redirected to. After reviewing the permissions WisdomAI is requesting, click **Allow** to grant access and install the app in your workspace.

4. Verify the `https://<account>.askwisdom.ai/slack` page shows that WisdomAI app is connected to your workspace.
5. Look for `@WisdomAI` app on your slack workspace and start using it. When you open a direct message with the app, you will see a welcome message and some suggested questions. You can now ask questions in natural language to get insights from your data directly within Slack.
