WisdomAI provides a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that enables direct integration with MCP-compatible clients. The MCP server exposes WisdomAI's powerful data analysis capabilities through standardized tool interfaces.

The server implements the [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification) with [**Streamable HTTP**](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#streamable-http) Transport. All responses include structured content that can be rendered as text, tables, or interactive charts.

## Get Started

The **WisdomAI MCP Server** provides real-time access to structured data insights through the standardized [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Users can ask questions related to business intelligence and receive structured responses, including tabular data, visualizations, and natural language explanations.

The WisdomAI MCP server provides a single endpoint for all operations:

```
https://{ACCOUNT}.askwisdom.ai/mcp
```

## Authentication Method

The MCP server uses Bearer token authentication. All requests must include a valid Auth token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
```

<Note>
  Contact our API team at `support@askwisdom.ai` to obtain your dedicated MCP Auth token.

### Session Management

The server supports session-based connections using the [MCP transport layer](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/basic/transports). Each session maintains its own context and can handle multiple sequential requests.
