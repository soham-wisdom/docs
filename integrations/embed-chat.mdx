title: "Embed Chat"

Embed a streamlined, white-label version of WisdomAI Chat directly into your application.

The page is loaded in an `iframe` and intentionally omits WisdomAI branding and features for a seamless integration experience. All core chat capabilities (naturalâ€‘language Q&A, table generation, and chart rendering) remain intact.

<Info>
  The embedded chat UI is hosted at: `https://<customer>.askwisdom.ai/chat/embed`

## 1. Request an Access Token

Your permanent Access Token authenticates your server to the WisdomAI API. This token does not expire and must be kept secret.

To get your token, contact the WisdomAI team and provide the email address of the user account you wish to associate with the token.

<Note>
  **Choose the Right User Account**

  - **Service Account (Recommended)**: If you use a service account's email, you won't need to manage sharing permissions for each Story you embed. This is the most scalable approach.
  - **Specific User Account**: If you use a specific user's email, any Story you want to embed must be explicitly shared with "everyone in the organization" from that user's account in WisdomAI.
</Note>

## 2. Generate a JWT Token

With your Access Token, you can now generate a temporary JWT for a user's session. This action must always be performed on your server to avoid leaking your permanent Access Token to the client's browser.

<Warning>
  Never expose your permanent Access Token in client-side code. It provides long-term access to the WisdomAI API and must be protected on your backend.
</Warning>

Make a server-side POST request to the WisdomAI GraphQL endpoint.

```bash
curl -X POST https://<customer>.askwisdom.ai/graphql -d "query Query($accessToken: String!) {
  exchangeAccessToken(accessToken: $accessToken)
}
```

Include your permanent Access Token in the variables of the GraphQL query.

**Example Request (using cURL):**

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "query": "query Query($accessToken: String!) { exchangeAccessToken(accessToken: $accessToken) }",
    "variables": {
      "accessToken": "YOUR_PERMANENT_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    }
  }' \
  https://<customer>.askwisdom.ai/graphql
```

The API will respond with the temporary JWT token.

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "exchangeAccessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
  }
}
```

<Info>
  For detailed information about the authentication flow and API usage, see the [Exchange Access Token](/integrations/graphql-api/queries/auth/exchange-access-token) documentation.

## 3. Embed the Chat

To embed the chat into your application, add the iframe shown below.

```html
<iframe
  src="https://<customer>.askwisdom.ai/chat/embed/{conversationId}?token=<signed-jwt>"
  style="width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;" />
```

In the `conversationId` you'd add the ID for this specific chat and in the token query param, add the signed `jwt-token` that you generated in step 2.

The embedded page controls the chat experience; no further state management is required after the initial load.
