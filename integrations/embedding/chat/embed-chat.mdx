Embed a streamlined, white-label version of WisdomAI Chat directly into your application.

<Info>
  The embedded chat UI is hosted at: `https://<customer>.askwisdom.ai/chat/embed`
</Info>

This guide outlines the process for embedding WisdomAI Chat into your application. Before proceeding, ensure you've reviewed the [main embedding documentation](/integrations/embedding/embedding) for authentication setup and security requirements.

## Embed WisdomAI Chat in your Application

To embed the chat into your application, add the iframe shown below.

```html
<iframe
  src="https://<customer>.askwisdom.ai/chat/embed?token=<signed-jwt>"
  style="width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;" />
```

In the token query param, add the signed `jwt-token` that you generated in the authentication stage. Each embedded chat session will automatically create a new conversation.

The embedded page controls the chat experience; no further state management is required after the initial load.
