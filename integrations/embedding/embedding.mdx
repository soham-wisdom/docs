title: "Embedding WisdomAI Chat and Stories"
---

Embed a streamlined, white-label version of WisdomAI chat/stories directly into your application.

The pages are loaded in an `iframe` and intentionally omits WisdomAI branding and features for a seamless integration experience. All core chat capabilities (naturalâ€‘language Q&A, table generation, and chart rendering) remain intact.

The section below describes the steps to configure your embedded chat/story.

## 1. Request an Access Token

Your permanent access token authenticates your server to the WisdomAI API and grants impersonation permissions. This token does not expire and must be kept secret.

Contact `support@askwisdom.ai` to obtain your access token. The access token will have impersonation permissions.

## 2. Generate a JWT Token

With your access token and the user email, you can now generate a temporary JWT that impersonates the specified user. This action must always be performed on your server to avoid leaking your permanent Access Token to the client's browser.

<Warning>
  Never expose your permanent access token in client-side code. It provides long-term impersonation capabilities and must be protected on your backend. Do not store, cache, or transmit this token to any client-side application, mobile app, or frontend code.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  The permanent access token grants impersonation privileges. If this token is compromised, an attacker could impersonate any user in your organization. Store it only in secure server-side environment variables or secret management systems.
</Warning>

Make a server-side POST request to the WisdomAI GraphQL endpoint.

```bash
curl -X POST https://<customer>.askwisdom.ai/graphql -d "query Query($accessToken: String!, $userEmail: String!) {
  impersonateUser(accessToken: $accessToken, userEmail: $userEmail)
}
```

Include your permanent access token and the user email in the variables of the GraphQL query.

**Example Request (using cURL):**

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "query": "query Query($accessToken: String!, $userEmail: String!) { impersonateUser(accessToken: $accessToken, userEmail: $userEmail) }",
    "variables": {
      "accessToken": "YOUR_PERMANENT_ACCESS_TOKEN",
      "userEmail": "user-email@yourcompany.com"
    }
  }' \
  https://<customer>.askwisdom.ai/graphql
```

The API will respond with the temporary JWT token that authenticates as the impersonated user.
