title: "Embed a Story"

This guide outlines the process for embedding a WisdomAI Story into your application. Before proceeding, ensure you've reviewed the [main embedding documentation](/integrations/embedding/Embedding) for authentication setup and security requirements.

## Construct the Embed URL

Construct the special embed URL for your Story and append the newly generated JWT in the authentication stage.

1. Take your original Story URL and insert `/embed/` before the Story's name and ID.
2. Append the JWT as a `token` query parameter.

**Original URL:**

`https://<customer>.askwisdom.ai/stories/name-id`

**Final Embed URL:**

`https://<customer>.askwisdom.ai/stories/embed/name-id?token=<JWT_FROM_STEP_1>`

## 3. Embed in your Application

You can now use this URL as the `src` for an `<iframe>` in your application:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://<customer>.askwisdom.ai/stories/embed/name-id?token=<JWT_TOKEN>"
  style="width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;" />
```

## Validation

To validate that the process worked, open the final embed URL in your browser. The WisdomAI Story should load correctly without prompting for a login. If you see an error, check the troubleshooting steps below.
