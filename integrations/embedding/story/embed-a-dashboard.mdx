title: "Embed a Dashboard"

This guide outlines the process for embedding a WisdomAI Dashboard into your application. Before proceeding, ensure you've reviewed the [main embedding documentation](/integrations/embedding/embedding) for authentication setup and security requirements.

## Construct the Embed URL

Construct the special embed URL for your Dashboard and append the newly generated JWT in the authentication stage.

1. Take your original Dashboard URL and insert `/embed/` before the Dashboard's name and ID.
2. Append the JWT as a `token` query parameter. The URL should look like the following:
   - **Original URL**: `https://<customer>.askwisdom.ai/dashboards/name-id`
   - **Final Embed URL**: `https://<customer>.askwisdom.ai/dashboards/embed/name-id?token=<JWT_FROM_STEP_1>`
3. You can now use this URL as the `src` for an `<iframe>` in your application:

   ```html
   <iframe
     src="https://<customer>.askwisdom.ai/dashboards/embed/name-id?token=<JWT_TOKEN>"
     style="width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;" />
   ```

<Note>
  **URL Update: Story to Dashboard**

  The embedding URL has been updated to use `/dashboards/` instead of `/stories/`. 

  If you are currently using an older URL containing `/stories/`, it will continue to work and does not require immediate replacement.
</Note>

## Validation

To validate that the process worked, open the final embed URL in your browser. The WisdomAI Dashboard should load correctly without prompting for a login. If you encounter an error, please refer to the troubleshooting steps below.
