title: "Create and Manage Prompt Templates"

Prompt templates allow you to turn successful queries into reusable building blocks for other users. Instead of starting from scratch, Explorers can use these templates to run complex analyses quickly.

## How Prompt Templates Creation Works

A prompt template starts as a normal chat interaction. When a response is [reviewed](/setting-up-wisdom-ai/feedback-mechanisms/reviewed-queries) and confirmed as useful, it can be converted into a reusable template.

This conversion is manual. An admin must explicitly enable the **Parameterized** toggle to turn the reviewed response into a prompt template.

After a template is created, Wisdom AI automatically organizes it. The system assigns the template to a **Topic**, which is simply a category used to group similar templates together. These topics are displayed as cards on the domain chat page, helping users discover relevant prompts.

## Autocomplete

Autocomplete uses existing prompt templates to suggest relevant queries as users type. It is domain-specific, meaning suggestions are generated only from prompts created within the current domain.

When a user starts typing in the main chat window, Wisdom AI searches the Prompt Gallery (if available) and displays matching prompts as clickable autocomplete suggestions.
