By subscribing to receive notifications, recipients can automatically get updates, such as reminders or content deliveries via email.

Use notifications to:

- Keep stakeholders in the loop.
- Ensure timely reviews or approvals.
- Automate regular Dashboard updates without manual follow-up.

Follow this guide to learn how to schedule Dashboards.

## Receive Dashboard Updates

1. Navigate to the **Dashboards** section in the left sidebar.
2. Find the Dashboard you would like to share, click on the kebab menu icon, and select **Subscribe**.

3. In the modal window that opens, you can create a new notifications schedule by configuring the following:
   - **When?**
     - Set the **Start Date**, for example, to 31/05/26 at 9:00 AM.
     - Choose the **Interval**, for example, Repeat every 2 Weeks.
   - **What?**
     - Select the **Delivery Method** (currently, only **email** is supported).
     - Enter the **recipient’s email address**. You can add more than one address by separating them with a comma.
4. Click on **Create** to save your scheduled notification.
