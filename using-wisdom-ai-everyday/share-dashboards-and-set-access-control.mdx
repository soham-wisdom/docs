You can share Dashboards with your entire team or grant access to specific users. Use the sharing option to:

- Collaborate across teams.
- Ensure key stakeholders have access to relevant, real-time data.
- Control who can view and interact with each Dashboard.

Follow this guide to learn how to share Dashboards.

## Share a Dashboard and Control Access

1. Navigate to the **Dashboards** section in the left sidebar.
2. Find the Dashboard you would like to share, click on the kebab menu icon, and select **Share**.

<Tip>
  You can also share the Dashboard you are working on by clicking on the Share icon in the toolbar.

  <Frame>
    <img
      src="images/share-dashboard-icon.png"
      alt="Share from Dashboard"
      className="hidden dark:block"
    />
    <img
      src="/images/share-dashboard-icon.png"
      alt="Share from Dashboard"
      className="dark:hidden"
    />
  </Frame>
</Tip>

3. In the modal window that opens, you can choose from the following options:

- **Select users to share with**. (In this case, only those specific users will gain access to view the Dashboard).
- Set a **General Access**. In this case, you can enable any of the following options :
  - **Share your Dashboard with everyone in your organization** so all members have access.
  - Share the provided **link** with anyone who needs access to the Dashboard.

4. Click **Done** to save your changes.
