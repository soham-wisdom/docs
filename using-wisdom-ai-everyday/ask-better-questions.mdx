## Make Clear, Natural Language Questions

WisdomAI understands everyday language, but being clear helps it understand you better.

- **Be Specific:** Instead of "Show sales," ask "Show total sales for the last quarter."
- **Use Exact Words:** Say "Count of customers who bought in the last 30 days," not "Customers buying stuff."
- **Ask for Summaries:** If you want totals or averages, say so. For example, "Sum of sales by product" or "Average sales per product."
- **State Time:** Always include dates or periods like "Last month" or "Between January and March 2024."
- **Hint at Connections:** Use words like "by," "who bought," or "per" to show relationships. For example, "Sales _by_ region."
- **Try Different Ways:** If a question doesn't work, try phrasing it differently.

### Ask a Question

1. Navigate to the **Search** window, in the left sidebar. The Chat page will open.
2. **Send a question** on the chat.
3. The chat will start preparing the answer. You will be able to see its **Workstream**:
   - The tool (data source) selected,
   - The step by step process,
   - Any join constrain validation,
   - The final query.

Once its ready, it will send you the **answer**, typically, in chart format.

## Use Filters for Better Focus

Filters help you narrow down your data to exactly what you need.

- **Set Conditions:** Don't just ask for "customers"; ask for "customers _in the US_" or "customers _who spent over \$500_."
- **Use Comparisons:**
  - **Equal:** `where Region is 'North'`
  - **More/Less:** `where Sales > 1000`
  - **Range:** `where Date between '2024-01-01' and '2024-03-31'`
  - **Contains:** `where Product Name contains 'Pro'`
- **Combine Filters:** Use "and," "or," and "not" for more detailed questions. For example, "Sales _where Product Category is 'Apparel' AND Region is 'West'_."
- **Exclude Things:** Sometimes it's easier to say what you _don't_ want. For example, "All customers _except those in California_."

### Add or Adjust Filters

After WisdomAI provides you with the answer, you will be able to:

1. See the **aplied filters**, according to your question, e.g.: Stage Label, Dates, etc.
2. **Add one or more filters**, such as Lead Source. Here, You also have the option to **Clear all filters**.

## Plan for Follow-Up Questions

One question rarely gives the full picture. Think about what you'll ask next to dig deeper.

- **Start Broad, Then Detail:** Begin with a general question, then ask for more specifics.
  - _First:_ "What were our total sales last quarter?"
  - _Next:_ "Which products sold the most?"
  - _Then:_ "How did our top product sell over the last year?"
- **Explore Surprises:** If something looks odd, ask why.
  - _Problem:_ "Sales in one area dropped last month."
  - _Ask:_ "What marketing happened there?" or "Were there many returns?"
- **Compare Things:** Look for differences and similarities.
  - _Question:_ "How do costs in Q1 compare to Q2?"
  - _Ask:_ "What caused that difference?"
- **Look at Different Angles:** If you're looking at sales by area, next look at sales by product or by customer.

## Use Business Terms Set by Admins

Your organization has a shared language for its data. Using these official terms is key.

- **What are Business Terms?**
  - They are the **official words** your company uses.
  - They define what "Customer," "Revenue," or "Active User" **really mean** for your business.
  - **Admins** usually create and manage them, often in a **business glossary**.
- **Why Are They Important?**
  - **Everyone Understands:** Ensures everyone means the same thing by "Sales."
  - **Correct Answers:** Prevents mistakes and helps you query the right data.
  - **Save Time:** Less time spent explaining terms.
  - **Trust Your Data:** When terms are clear, data is more reliable.
  - **Better Questions:** Helps you use the exact words **WisdomAI** understands.
- **How to Use Them:**
  - **Check Your Company's Glossary:** Always look up terms there first.
  - **Use Exact Words:** If "Sales" is officially "Total Recognized Sales (USD)," use that.
  - **Understand What's Behind It:** Even if you don't use database names, knowing how a term like "Active Customer" is defined (e.g., active in the last 90 days) helps you ask better questions.
  - **Ask if Unsure:** If a term is unclear, ask your data team. This helps everyone.
  - **Help Others:** Encourage colleagues to use the standard terms too.

By following these steps, you'll ask stronger questions and get more meaningful insights from your data using **WisdomAI**.
