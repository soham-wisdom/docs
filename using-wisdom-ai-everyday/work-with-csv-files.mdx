title: "Work with CSV Files"
---

With WisdomAI, you can integrate and analyze data stored in **CSV**, **TSV**, or **Excel** files. Depending on your goals and permissions, there are three distinct ways to work with these files.

## 1. Add Data to a Domain (Admins)

**Best for:** Making a dataset available to your entire team permanently.

Admins can add CSV files as tables within a shared domain. This change affects the domain-level schema, meaning every Explorer assigned to that domain can query this data.

1. Navigate to **Domains** and select your target domain.
2. Click the **Data Sources** tab.
3. Click **Add Table** \> **from CSV file**.

Proceed to [File Configuration](#file-configuration) to finalize the upload logic and data structure.

## 2. Create a Private Domain (Admins/Explorers)

**Best for:** One-off analysis or testing a dataset before sharing it.

Admins or Explorers can create their own "Sandbox" domains by uploading a file. These domains are private by default; no other user can see them unless the creator explicitly shares them.

1. Navigate to the **Homepage**.
2. Click the **Domain switcher**.
3. Select the **Upload CSV file...** option.

Proceed to [File Configuration](#file-configuration) to finalize the upload logic and data structure.

### File configuration

After initiating an upload from a domain or the Homepage, you must define how the system handles the file:

4. Choose your destination logic:
   - **New Domain**: (Default option) The system creates a new domain from the uploaded file.
   - **Existing Domain**: Select an existing domain (e.g., "B2B Sales - 1Q25") from the **Add to Domain** dropdown.
5. Select the **Table Operation**:
   - **Add as a new CSV Table**: Creates a fresh table within the selected domain.
   - **Replace an existing CSV Table**: Updates the data of a specific table while preserving settings.

6. If replacing data, select the specific table to be replaced from the **Select table to replace** dropdown.
7. Drag and drop your file into the upload area or click to browse.
8. Click **Continue**.

### Data structure verification

Once the file is uploaded, verify the data structure to ensure accurate analysis:

9. **Configure Columns**: Review the detected column types (e.g., String, Integer). You can unmark the checkboxes to exclude specific columns from the upload.
2. Click **Preview**.

11. Ensure the data in the preview grid maps correctly. Click **Create table** (or **Replace table** if updating an existing one).

<Info>
  **Data Replacement Behavior**

  When you replace an existing CSV table, the system updates only the raw data. All existing column descriptions, settings, and domain configurations remain intact, only the table data itself is replaced.

## 3. Attach a File to a Chat (Admins/Explorers)

**Best for**: Asking quick questions about a specific file without creating a new domain.

You can upload a file directly into a chat session. While the chat still uses your active domain for general context, the AI will prioritize the data in your uploaded file for that specific conversation.

1. Open any Chat.
2. Click the **Attachment (paperclip)** icon in the message bar.
3. Upload your file.

<Tip>
  You can add more than one file and compare them.
</Tip>

4. Ask questions immediately (e.g., "Summarize the trends in this file").
