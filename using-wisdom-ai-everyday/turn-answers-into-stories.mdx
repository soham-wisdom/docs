title: "Turn Answers into Dashboards"
---

Dashboards provide a centralized view of your key business metrics and data visualizations, transforming individual responses into a live reporting hub. You can create Dashboards directly from Chat Responses or from the Dashboard Editor interface. With Dashboards, you can:

- Create dynamic narratives using your data.
- Customize layouts and visuals from responses to suit your audience.
- Share updates that **automatically reflect the changes** in your datasets.

Follow this guide to start building Dashboards and communicate insights clearly and effectively.

## Create Dashboards from Chat Responses

1. Within your chat window, click on the contextual menu icon labeled "In this chat."
2. Select one or more **answers** that you would like to include in your Dashboard.
3. Click on **Add to Dashboard**.

Based on your question and query, WisdomAI may generate a visual representation, such as a chart or graph, that you can review and add directly to the Dashboard.
6. Click on the **Add latest visualization as a widget** button to save the response (a chart in this example) in the Dashboard.
