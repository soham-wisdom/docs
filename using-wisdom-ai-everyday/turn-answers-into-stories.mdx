Stories in WisdomAI are interactive, shareable dashboard-like narratives that transform complex data analyses into compelling visual presentations. They are designed to facilitate understanding, collaboration, and data-driven decision-making across teams.

Follow this guide to create Stories and effectively communicate your insights by turning raw data into clear, engaging narratives that anyone on your team can understand and act upon.

2. Click on the **Add latest visualization as a widget** button.
