Stories are data dashboards created from chat answers. You can create Stories directly from Chat Responses or from the Story Editor interface. With Stories, you can:

- Create dynamic narratives using your data.
- Customize layouts and visuals from responses to suit your audience.
- Share updates that **automatically reflect the changes** in your datasets.

Follow this guide to start building Stories and communicate insights clearly and effectively.

## Create Stories from Chat Responses

1. Within your chat window, click on the contextual menu icon labeled "In this chat."
2. Select one or more **answers** that you would like to include in your Story.

5. The **Add visualization widget** modal window will open.  In this window, you can ask WisdomAI a question about your data in natural language. Based on your question and query, WisdomAI may generate a visual representation, such as a chart or graph, that you can review and add directly to the Story.
6. Click on the **Add latest visualization as a widget** button to save the response (a chart in this example) in the Story.
